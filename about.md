- <sub> Having an years long experience as a DevOps Engineer, I’ve been writing fully automated product releases, with minimal interference on the client enterprise end.</sub>
- <sub>  As a summer trainee at Dgplug, I've learnt</sub>
    - <sub>how to set up and manage multiple Linux-based servers. (Actually, dgplug is from where all my DevOps learning started :))</sub>
    - <sub>how to write Infrastructure as Code(IaC) to automate setting up of tightly-secured and SSH-hardened systems/servers.</sub>
    - <sub>how to manage multi-cluster (micro-services) applications in an On-Premise Deployment setup. Further expanding to Cluster (and other included resources) monitoring, health-checks, alerts, managing updates/upgrades and finally Disaster Recovery (basically backup and restore mechanism).</sub>
