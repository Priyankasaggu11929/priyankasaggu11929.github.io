***Hello, I'm Priyanka Saggu.***

I'm in the process of learning everyday. 

But to give a little excerpt from the learnings so far, here is who I'm:

1. <sub>A rsesourceful DevOps enthusiast, having experience working with highly distributed infrastructure on hybrid cloud platforms.</sub> 
2. <sub>While my internship at [Atlan](https://atlan.com), I’ve been working on writing fully automated product releases, with zero interference on the client enterprise end. 
3. <sub>As a summer trainee at Dgplug, I've learnt
    - <sub>how to set up and manage multiple Linux-based servers. (Actually, dgplug is from where all my DevOps learning started :))</sub>
    - <sub>how to write Infrastructure as Code(IaC) to automate setting up of tightly-secured and SSH-hardened systems/servers.</sub>
    - <sub>how to manage multi-cluster (micro-services) applications in an On-Premise Deployment setup. Further expanding to Cluster (and other included resources) monitoring, health-checks, alerts, managing updates/upgrades and finally Disaster Recovery (basically backup and restore mechanism).</sub>
4. <sub>And I’m an [Outreachy’19 alum at GNOME Foundation](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/) too.</sub>

<sub>And the resume is [here](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/resume/).</sub>

<sub>The internet has accumulated plenty of my other fingerprints too, some of which you can find in these places:</sub>
