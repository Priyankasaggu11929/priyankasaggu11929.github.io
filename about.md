Hi, I'm Priyanka Saggu.

A resourceful DevOps enthusiast with experience in networking and programming. As a summer trainee at [Dgplug](https://dgplug.org/archive/), I have set up and managed multiple Linux servers, Wrote Infrastructure as Code(IaC) to automate setting up of tightly-secured and SSH-hardened systems/servers. Now-a-days, working closely under the guidance of some exceptionally outstanding mentors from leading upstream open-source projects. And now an [Outreachy'19 intern at GNOME Foundation](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/) as well.

You can check my resume [here](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/resume/).

The internet has accumulated plenty of my fingerprints, some of which you can find in these places:
