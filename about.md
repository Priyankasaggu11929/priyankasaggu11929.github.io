Hi, I'm Priyanka Saggu.

Resourceful DevOps enthusiast, having experience working with highly distributed infrastructure on hybrid cloud platforms. During the internship at Atlan, I’ve been working on writing fully automated product releases, with zero interference on the client enterprise end. As a summer trainee at Dgplug, I have set up and managed multiple Linux-based servers. Wrote Infrastructure as Code(IaC) to automate setting up of tightly-secured and SSH-hardened systems/servers. Have experience with On-Prem deployment environments using Rancher. And I’m an Outreachy’19 alum at GNOME Foundation too.

You can check my resume [here](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/resume/).

The internet has accumulated plenty of my fingerprints, some of which you can find in these places:
