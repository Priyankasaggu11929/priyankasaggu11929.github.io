***Ok, I realised I'm developing this new hobby of writing hand-written book notes or just notes, so a new page now.***

***Although it takes a lot of time, so, I don't know how frequent or how long I will keep at it. But I have a couple of them now, so putting them here..***

*(PS: The Original idea was to keep it as a doodle page, but I think I'm very bad at drawing right now.)*
