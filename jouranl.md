***A space for me, to free myself from the silent struggle of writing a whole blogpost, when I just want to write down a single line of thought.***

***This is my personal journal where I wish (and want) to lay down something everyday!***

*May 18, 2020*

<sub>Started the day with the audio-book ***[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFZjtyJ10x8)*** by *Mark Manson*.</sub>

<sub>I wanted to write down my own book notes for the sake of my memory, but couldn't figure out how to do that while listening to an audio book. So, for now will be using my mentor's notes from [here](https://mjbraganza.com/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck/#fnref:1).</sub> 

<sub>The office working hours were peaceful today. I finished most of my tasks. Also came across this repository [kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) for expanding my little kubernetes knowledge onto really deeper architecture's side (a senior colleague pointed this out).</sub>

<sub>Today was a busy day. Hopefully, will slowly start implementing this from tomorrow.</sub>

<sub>Finally, I have my personal journal space.</sub>

<sub>After seeing the [fitness](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) page getting slowly filled with something to read from my own life, now, I feel I should have a space for writing my all other bitter-sweet moments (from my life) too.</sub>

<sub>I'm feeling really positive about it. It's because somehow I've ***finally*** build-up this feeling that I *should* write ***just for myself*** too (*Just to keep myself motivated & my future-self aware of the things happening right now.*)</sub>

<sub>Besides, Today I started my day with [this podcast](https://overcast.fm/+Kebtj4G94) from *Tim Ferris with Elizabeth Gilbert*. And my biggest takeaway was this extremely useful phrase/reply, **Thank you and no!** (*This simple phrase is meant to save from giving any explanations/reasons to extra-smart-manipulative people while answering them a straightaway gentle no!*)</sub>
