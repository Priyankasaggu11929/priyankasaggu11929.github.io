***A space for me, to free myself from the silent struggle of writing a whole blogpost, when I just want to write down a single line of thought.***

***This is my personal journal where I wish (and want) to lay down something everyday!***

## *May 20, 2020*

<sub>***[09:48 am] A good start of the day...***</sub>

<sub>Watched a video about [evening routine of Tim Ferris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLYqhezACpc). I really have no idea if I could follow it any time soon in my life, but maybe someday I can come up with my own version of it. (Sadly, I'm missing the idea around that video and getting highly deviated towards working hard to get that much of luxury life someday. Yes, that's my plan :D )</sub>

<sub>Today's good feed happened just out of nowhere. I was reading one of the tweets around #100daysofJobSearch, and I found this *Ramit Sethi's* video on [How to write a Winning Resume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0fjkKCsM1w) in one of the threads. Although, I didn't see myself writing a new resume anytime before watching this video. Now, I think I'll definitely go back and check where I can improve (While I'm actually a little happy with the way my current resume is, because I see that also includes a little narrative. Certainly, I don't think that is the best one, but definitely the best one I've come up with, so far & feel quite confident while sharing. I'm actually looking forward to improving it with the learnings from *Ramit Sethi's* (dated) resume. Yes, his dated resume also speaks a *looot*.)</sub>

<sub>It's just the start of the day & I think I already have my first best thing. Ah, actually 2 best things.</sub>
- <sub>I wrote my first **morning pages**. It's totally worth it. I know it's just the first day of writing it. But I'm totally fascinated by the way how I laid down all my running thoughts in multiple pages, in absolutely no time at all. No thinking required, nothing. Just wrote everything I felt like writing & done!</sub>
- <sub>I started reading **learning Python** by *Mark Lutz* (I admit I wouldn't have recalled the author's name at all, if in that one paragraph where he started like *"After using it for 21 years, writing about it for 18, and teaching it for 16, I've found..."*, my attention just went onto looking for who is this *"I"* here & I checked the author's name. Not really proud, but yes, that's how I remember the author's name XD). I'm done reading the first chapter *"A Python Q&A session"* & have just started with the second one, *"How Python Runs Programs"*. The best part was that I read it without getting distracted at all. I read around 11 leaves (22 pages) in one hour & that's the maximum for me so far. :)</sub>

<sub>(*Okay, honestly speaking, the intent for reading the book was not to learn Python, but just to start reading some book. I know a little bit of Python to get my work done somehow, definitely after tinkering for almost everything on internet. But now, I think It's interesting to know the fundamentals, to get to know about things that I never knew before. For instance,  Python is named after the British Comedy group, Monty Python. So, now, I look forward to learning more about the technical fundamentals as I read it through (hopefully).*)</sub>

<sub>And thanks, jasonbraganza for the book (and books). I finally started reading it today.</sub>

## *May 19, 2020*

<sub>Trying to build this habit of feeding my brain with something good (and something that I can start applying to improve me) every morning now.</sub>

<sub>Today's good feed: [How I Journal and Take Notes | Brainstorming + Focusing + Reducing Anxiety | Tim Ferriss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA)</sub>

<sub>And the takeaways:</sub>
- <sub>Do crazy quick brainstorming with yourself, to lay down all the crazy quick thoughts on some specific usecase.</sub>
- <sub>Writing ***morning Pages*** (for reducing anxiety at the very start of day itself).</sub>
- <sub>Discrete bullet points for, `what went well during the day?`, `what I'm grateful to?` and `How could I've made today better?`.</sub>
- <sub>And last, doing all 3 of them at one time is not required. But just one at a time will definitely help in future.</sub>

<sub>I'm still thinking what parts I can include here itself but *morning pages* is what I'm definitely looking to move forward with.</sub>

<sub>***[00:39 am] Finishing the day now...***</sub>

<sub>Fortunately, Office hours were peaceful today. Although leaving very late, but have finished all my tasks for the day.</sub>

<sub>Happy that finally my concepts are getting nicely cleared.</sub>

<sub>The best thing from the day is that I've finally gained some muscles today with equivalent fat loss.</sub>

<sub>I still missed my personal work commitments. Need to really prioritise them in life.</sub>

## *May 18, 2020*

<sub>Started the day with the audio-book ***[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFZjtyJ10x8)*** by *Mark Manson*.</sub>

<sub>I wanted to write down my own book notes for the sake of my memory, but couldn't figure out how to do that while listening to an audio book. So, for now will be using my mentor's notes from [here](https://mjbraganza.com/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck/#fnref:1).</sub> 

<sub>The office working hours were peaceful today. I finished most of my tasks. Also came across this repository [kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) for expanding my little kubernetes knowledge onto really deeper architecture's side (a senior colleague pointed this out).</sub>

<sub>Today was a busy day. Hopefully, will slowly start implementing this from tomorrow.</sub>

<sub>Just came across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1262237918309109760). Reminded me once again that I've to be really thoughful about my own decisions too.</sub>

## *May 17, 2020*

<sub>Finally, I have my personal journal space.</sub>

<sub>After seeing the [fitness](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) page getting slowly filled with something to read from my own life, now, I feel I should have a space for writing my all other bitter-sweet moments (from my life) too.</sub>

<sub>I'm feeling really positive about it. It's because somehow I've ***finally*** build-up this feeling that I *should* write ***just for myself*** too (*Just to keep myself motivated & my future-self aware of the things happening right now.*)</sub>

<sub>Besides, Today I started my day with [this podcast](https://overcast.fm/+Kebtj4G94) from *Tim Ferris with Elizabeth Gilbert*. And my biggest takeaway was this extremely useful phrase/reply, **Thank you and no!**</sub>

<sub>(*A simple phrase meant to save me from giving any explanations/reasons to the extra-smart-manipulative people while answering them, a straightaway gentle no!*)</sub>
