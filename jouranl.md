***A space for me, to free myself from the silent struggle of writing a whole blogpost, even if I just want to write down a single line of thought.***

***This is my personal journal where I wish (and want) to lay down something everyday!***

<sub>Finally, I have my personal journal space.</sub>

<sub>After seeing the [fitness](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) page getting slowly filled with something to read from my own life, now, I feel I should have a space for writing my all other bitter-sweet moments (from my life) too.</sub>

<sub>I'm feeling really positive about it. It's because somehow I've ***finally*** build-up this feeling that I *should* write ***just for myself*** too.</sub>

<sub>*Just to keep myself motivated & my future-self aware of the things happening right now.* :)</sub>
