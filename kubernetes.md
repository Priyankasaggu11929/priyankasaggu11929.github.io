***I joined the the kubernetes community slack, sometime in the middle of june, 2020.***

***I started by getting involved with the (then) newly formed, [node-reviewers-group](https://www.psaggu.com/kubernetes-mentorship/2020/07/30/node-reviewer-group-tasks.html) which was kind of a mentorship program where a group of people would work together on reviewing/triaging `sig-node` PR(s) & issue(s).***

***I spent couple of months in the group, trying to understand all what was being taught (or discussed) in there, but I soon realised, nothing (absolutely nothing) made sense to me. I was too overwhelmed by the concepts being discussed there, I felt absolutely alien-ish in that space. So, I gave up & left.***

***Fortunately that was not the end for me!***

***I'm back to getting involved in the Kubernetes organisation, fully active this time. I have already started contributing with code.*** ðŸ™‚

***This will be a running logging document for all my upstream Kubernetes project contributions.***

## *March, 2021*

I first started writing kubernetes flavor of go code while working on the [integreatly-operator](https://github.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator) project which is an `Openshift Operator` based on the Operator SDK for installing and reconciling Integreatly services.

Following are the PRs for the changes I worked on:

- [Add custom alertmanager go template to enhance email config #1721](https://github.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/pull/1721)
- [Add alertmanager config changes #1672](https://github.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/pull/1672)
- [fix hardcoded addon value in controllers/rhmi/promethuesRules.go #1649](https://github.com/integr8ly/integreatly-operator/pull/1649)

## *June, 2020*

My very first PR on the upstream kubernetes project was:

- [Update broken file link in title 3 #4896](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/4896)
