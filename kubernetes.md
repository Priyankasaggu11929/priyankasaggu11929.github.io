***I joined the the kubernetes community slack, sometime in the middle of july, 2020.***

***I started by getting involved with the (then) newly formed, [node-reviewers-group](https://www.psaggu.com/kubernetes-mentorship/2020/07/30/node-reviewer-group-tasks.html) which was kind of a mentorship program where a group of people would work together on reviewing/triaging `sig-node` PR(s) & issue(s).***

***I spent couple of months in the group, trying to understand all what was being taught (or discussed) in there, but I soon realised, nothing (absolutely nothing) made sense to me. I was too overwhelmed by the concepts being discussed there, I felt absolutely alien-ish in that space. So, I gave up & left.***

***Fortunately that was not the end for me!***

***I'm back to getting involved in the Kubernetes organisation, fully active this time. I have already started contributing with code.*** ðŸ™‚
