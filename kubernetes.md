*I joined the the kubernetes community slack, sometime in the middle of july, 2020. I started by getting involved with the (then) newly formed, [node-reviewer-group](https://www.psaggu.com/kubernetes-mentorship/2020/07/30/node-reviewer-group-tasks.html) which was in a way mentorship program where people would work together on reviewing/triaging `sig-node` PR(s) & issue(s). I spent couple of months in the group, trying to understand all what was being taught (or discussed) in there, but I soon realised, nothing (absolutely nothing) made sense to me. I was too overwhelmed by the concepts being discussed there, I felt absolutely alien-ish in that space. So, I left.*

***Fortunately that's not the end!***

*I'm back to getting involved in the Kubernetes organisation, fully active this time. And guess what I have already started contributing with code. ðŸ™‚*

***This will be a logging document for all my upstream Kubernetes project contributions so far, all new ones moving forward.***
