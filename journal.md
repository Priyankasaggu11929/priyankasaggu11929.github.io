## *May 22, 2020*

<sub>***[15:21 pm] Finally writing the first half here...***</sub>

<sub>I woke up early, first at 6, then at 8, did something (maybe scrolled through twitter, or through youtube), started listening to this podcast from [Tim Ferris with Kevin Hart](https://tim.blog/2020/05/20/kevin-hart/), but slept back again in midway and finally then woke up at 10:10 am.</sub>

<sub>As usual (or actually my 3 days old usual), I started reading chapter 3, "*How you run programs*" from **Learning Python** by Mark Lutz. Finished some 10 pages (5 leaves) and left. Wrote my morning pages (today they actually became late morning pages, but anyways I kept the streak).</sub>

<sub>Finally after so long, got to talk to my mentor a bit (and that ultimately became my good feed (and the best thing) for the day). :)</sub>

<sub>Started working late today, around 1:45 pm. I had to prepare, cook & then eat, apart from the time to all the good habits I am trying to build now-a-days.</sub>

<sub>Mom's got injured yesterday. And so, when I had to do a couple more things with my new usuals, I realised it's hard, it's *real* hard to handle everything at once (although my *everything* was nothing of a big deal, but just to cook some food and that's all). Also, it's not that I don't cook, I actually cook every single day but then at these times mom is well, and so everything looks super cool.</sub>

<sub>So far, it's going good. :)</sub>

<sub>***[10:58 am] Not so late (but late) start of the day...***</sub>

<sub>I'm done with writing my morning pages. I'm happy atleast I kept it for the second day now. I hope I'll continue!</sub>

<sub>Today's good feed comes all the way from *Richard Feynman*. I spent about an hour reading lots of tweets from his twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/ProfFeynman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). I realised even few words of great wisdom in a sentence teaches enormously.</sub>

<sub>This one stuck my attention for the most (I even shared in the working slack & few folks thanked me for sharing it there)</sub>

<sub>***The more you know, the more you know what you donâ€™t know! 
What you know is inside a circle, what you don't know is outside of it. The circumference is what you know you don't know. As your knowledge grows, the circle grows and the circumference expands.***<sub>

![What-you-know-you-don't-know](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ETcHRYaUMAANaEH.jpg)

<sub>I'm super proud (yes, ofcourse of myself :p)! I finished reading another chapter "How Python Runs Program" from *"Learning Python by Mark Lutz"* (oh, I still remember the author's name XD).</sub>

<sub>Today I learnt about *Python's view* of program execution, thus, learnt about *Byte Code Compilation* & *Python Virtual Machine (PVM)*. Then had a brief intro to some of the *Python Implementation Alternative* like:</sub>
- <sub>CPython (the standard implementation of Python that we mostly encounter as the pre-installed Python in our (linux/mac OS) systems)</sub>
- <sub>JPython (Python for Java)</sub>
- <sub>IronPython (Python for .NET)</sub>
- <sub>Stackless (Python for concurrency)</sub>
- <sub>PyPy (Python for speed)</sub>

<sub>Then a little bit about *Execution Optimization Tools* like Cython (a Python C hybrid), Shed Skin (a Python-to-C++ translator) and Pysco (the original just-in-time compiler) which is no longer maintained & mostly logistically incorporated into the more complete PyPy system. And finally ended knowing about *Frozen Binaries* that bundle together the byte code of the program files, along with the PVM (interpreter) & any Python support files the program needs, into a single binary executable program/package.</sub>

<sub>I'm definitely learning a lot, even from my small reading time. Totally enjoying it!</sub>

<sub>***[00:02 am] Wrapping up work now...***</sub>

<sub>Ok, I was able to work properly (I mean I had my focus in place). Although couldn't finish my stuffs, but I learnt a lot. Today, it was all about setting up the observability part of the stack, thus, more of making grafana dashboards for loki as data-source for metrics, querying logs for certain field specific data.</sub>

<sub>The entire day went into learning, then re-learning, exploring more & finally just relasing that it was not enough. So, will give another good try tomorrow.</sub>

<sub>Apart from work, today, a couple of good things happened.</sub>

- <sub>I got an appreciating message from a friend on twitter, for the [fitness logging](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) I do around my weight loss journey. It was a really satisfying feeling for the reason that something like my (fitness) journey could be impressive to others. Truly, it was a happy moment for me. :)</sub>
- <sub>And then the best thing of the day. I got to have a quick, short & a really extremely wonderful coversation with ***Mark Rushing*** (*Public Cloud IaaS Service Owner, Citi*). I consider reaching out to him as one of the best things I've done so far for myself (this was the first time I actually reached out to someone without knowing them at all). And I think, it was *totally* worth it.</sub>

<sub>This impromptu meeting happened during the networking hours of the [cloud native virtual festival, "Software Circus: Down the Rabbit Hole"](https://www.softwarecircus.io/). I got to gather a looot in a very short time. All from the intro to the DevOps, the work we do, the culture, tools, platforms, practices we follow, and then some really great resources for learning & pointers to explore, a quick nice bit about jobs & corresponding requirements, fundamentals around the domain & I think a lot more too. The biggest takeway was his teachings around the importance of collaboration & communication (especially in DevOps). He was incredibly nice with his time, words & guidance, and with sharing his life & work experience around many things. It couldn't have been any better in that short period of time.</sub>

<sub>Lastly, I was happy today because I touched my second goal weight & turned an year younger in my metabolic age, on the scale. Although that way I'm still 6 years older than my actual age, but there are improvements & I take them as my small & steady wins. :)</sub>

<sub>It was a good day overall!</sub>

## *May 20, 2020*

<sub>***[09:48 am] A good start of the day...***</sub>

<sub>Watched a video about [evening routine of Tim Ferris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLYqhezACpc). I really have no idea if I could follow it any time soon in my life, but maybe someday I can come up with my own version of it. (Sadly, I'm missing the idea around that video and getting highly deviated towards *working hard* to get that much of luxury life someday. Actually yes, that *is* my plan :D )</sub>

<sub>Today's good feed happened just out of nowhere. I was reading one of the tweets around #100daysofJobSearch, and I found this *Ramit Sethi's* video on [How to write a Winning Resume](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0fjkKCsM1w) in one of the threads. Although, I didn't see myself writing a new resume anytime before watching this video. Now, I think I'll definitely go back and check where I can improve (While I'm actually a little happy with the way my current resume is, because I see that also includes a little narrative. Certainly, I don't think that is the best one, but definitely the best one I've come up with, so far & feel quite confident while sharing. I'm actually looking forward to improving it with the learnings from *Ramit Sethi's* (dated) resume. Yes, his dated resume also speaks a *looot*.)</sub>

<sub>It's just the start of the day & I think I already have my first best thing. Ah, actually 2 best things.</sub>
- <sub>I wrote my first **morning pages**. It's totally worth it. I know it's just the first day of writing it. But I'm totally fascinated by the way how I laid down all my running thoughts in multiple pages, in absolutely no time at all. No thinking required, nothing. Just wrote everything I felt like writing & done!</sub>
- <sub>I started reading **learning Python** by *Mark Lutz* (I admit I wouldn't have recalled the author's name at all, if in that one paragraph where he started like *"After using it for 21 years, writing about it for 18, and teaching it for 16, I've found..."*, my attention just went onto looking for who is this *"I"* here & I checked the author's name. Not really proud, but yes, that's how I remember the author's name XD). I'm done reading the first chapter *"A Python Q&A session"* & have just started with the second one, *"How Python Runs Programs"*. The best part was that I read it without getting distracted at all. I read around 11 leaves (22 pages) in one hour & that's the maximum for me so far. :)</sub>

<sub>(*Okay, honestly speaking, the intent for reading the book was not to learn Python, but just to start reading some book. I know a little bit of Python to get my work done somehow, definitely after tinkering for almost everything on internet. But now, I think It's interesting to know the fundamentals, to get to know about things that I never knew before. For instance,  Python is named after the British Comedy group, Monty Python. So, now, I look forward to learning more about the technical fundamentals as I read it through (hopefully).*)</sub>

<sub>And thanks jasonbraganza, for the book (and books). I finally started reading it today.</sub>

<sub>***[11:06 pm] Finally logged off from work...***</sub>

<sub>Very sleepy now. Not a productive working day. Kept struggling all day to focus & finally when I managed to focus, my body just started feeling super sleepy.</sub>

<sub>Wrote my first ever cover letter today. I'm happy the way it turned out. But I admit, writing resume or a cover letter or an essay type application is still really very hard for me. I loose all my vocabulary (whatsoever I have at other times) when I've to write about my own experiences, skills & stuff. But I think a work commitment helps here. It just bound me to do the work.</sub>

<sub>Apart from that, today I finally went back to a couple of folks, expressing my long pending gratitude for the help, guidance & pointers I'd received from them in past months. I realise a simple vote of thanks makes both the ends really happy & acknowledged. :)</sub>

<sub>It would have been much better today, if I had proper focus during the working hours. Just lacked some self-motivation to work. But actually it's ok. Today was one such odd lazy day. Hopefully, I will do better tomorrow!</sub>

## *May 19, 2020*

<sub>Trying to build this habit of feeding my brain with something good (and something that I can start applying to improve me) every morning now.</sub>

<sub>Today's good feed: [How I Journal and Take Notes | Brainstorming + Focusing + Reducing Anxiety | Tim Ferriss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA)</sub>

<sub>And the takeaways:</sub>
- <sub>Do crazy quick brainstorming with yourself, to lay down all the crazy quick thoughts on some specific usecase.</sub>
- <sub>Writing ***morning Pages*** (for reducing anxiety at the very start of day itself).</sub>
- <sub>Discrete bullet points for, `what went well during the day?`, `what I'm grateful to?` and `How could I've made today better?`.</sub>
- <sub>And last, doing all 3 of them at one time is not required. But just one at a time will definitely help in future.</sub>

<sub>I'm still thinking what parts I can include here itself but *morning pages* is what I'm definitely looking to move forward with.</sub>

<sub>***[00:39 am] Finishing the day now...***</sub>

<sub>Fortunately, Office hours were peaceful today. Although leaving very late, but have finished all my tasks for the day.</sub>

<sub>Happy that finally my concepts are getting nicely cleared.</sub>

<sub>The best thing from the day is that I've finally gained some muscles today with equivalent fat loss.</sub>

<sub>I still missed my personal work commitments. Need to really prioritise them in life.</sub>

## *May 18, 2020*

<sub>Started the day with the audio-book ***[The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFZjtyJ10x8)*** by *Mark Manson*.</sub>

<sub>I wanted to write down my own book notes for the sake of my memory, but couldn't figure out how to do that while listening to an audio book. So, for now will be using my mentor's notes from [here](https://mjbraganza.com/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-f-ck/#fnref:1).</sub> 

<sub>The office working hours were peaceful today. I finished most of my tasks. Also came across this repository [kubernetes-the-hard-way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way) for expanding my little kubernetes knowledge onto really deeper architecture's side (a senior colleague pointed this out).</sub>

<sub>Today was a busy day. Hopefully, will slowly start implementing this from tomorrow.</sub>

<sub>Just came across [this tweet](https://twitter.com/IanColdwater/status/1262237918309109760). Reminded me once again that I've to be really thoughful about my own decisions too.</sub>

---

## *May 17, 2020*

<sub>Finally, I have my personal journal space.</sub>

<sub>After seeing the [fitness](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html) page getting slowly filled with something to read from my own life, now, I feel I should have a space for writing my all other bitter-sweet moments (from my life) too.</sub>

<sub>I'm feeling really positive about it. It's because somehow I've ***finally*** build-up this feeling that I *should* write ***just for myself*** too (*Just to keep myself motivated & my future-self aware of the things happening right now.*)</sub>

<sub>Besides, today I started my day with [this podcast](https://overcast.fm/+Kebtj4G94) from *Tim Ferris with Elizabeth Gilbert*. And my biggest takeaway was this extremely useful phrase/reply, **Thank you and no!**</sub>

<sub>(*A simple phrase meant to save me from giving any explanations/reasons to the extra-smart-manipulative people while answering them, a straightaway gentle no!*)</sub>
