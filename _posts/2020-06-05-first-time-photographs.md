Apart from the office work, nowadays, I'm mostly working on building some good habits (while improving the bad ones). 

*(Reading good books, writing morning pages and [daily journals](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/journal.html), taking occassional [hand-written notes](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/notes.html) and doing my [meditation](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/meditation.html), are some of the few that I'm very very happy about.)*

And now, I'm also getting my hands dirty with few other fun activities too. 

***Today, it's Photography!*** 

My father have this *Canon 1500D* camera, mostly resting in one corner of the home. I had tried a couple of times before to actually learn using this, but sadly, there was no success so far. 

But finally today (*with some help from a family member*), I actually managed to click my first few pictures.

I'm happy with them (after all they are my first ever clicks). ‚ò∫Ô∏è

(*And now, I'm also aware of the basic jargons -- exposure, shutter-speed, aperture, ISO. 


OH YES, THIS WAS A BIG DEAL FOR ME ALL THIS WHILE üòÖÔ∏è*)
