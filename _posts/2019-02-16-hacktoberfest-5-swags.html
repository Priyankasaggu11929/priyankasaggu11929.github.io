<p>Every contribution counts and yup mine also did. A cheer moment for me. I finally received the Hacktoberfest swags. My first set of Programming Stickers and the T-Shirt. :) </p>

<p>Just one thing for all the folks who have just entered into Open Source Community. Never judge your contributions with the amount of coding/programming you know. Your contribution could be anything from a line of code, writing documentation, correcting typos, small patches or writing entirely a new feature to the project. </p>

<p>I started because once my mentor taught this to me, and now, I am passing it to you all.</p>
