***Quick notes from today:***

- ***[Version v1.5.0 for containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v1.5.0)*** is GA now. I raised multiple PRs to bump `containerd` version to `v1.5.0` in the following kubernetes sub-projects:
    -  [kubernetes /test-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22157)
    -  [containerd /zfs](https://github.com/containerd/zfs/pull/47)
    -  [kubernetes-sigs/image-builder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/pull/606)      
- The first two are merged & third one is marked `lgtm` & awaiting `approved` label.
- While working on the `containerd/zfs` PR, I got to learn a lot of new stuff (simple, but well I wasn't aware of them. And there is always a first time for everything):
    - Got to know about **[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin)**. In context of this PR, it basically meant I needed to sign my PR commits with a gpg key (linked to the email address similar to what I have used to sign the *Contributors License Agreement (CLA)*). And followed by that, I need to add `Signed-off-by: Priyanka Saggu <something@example.com>` in the commit description itself, so when the GitHub workflow runs to validate the DCO check, it goes through the checks smoothly (and this part is what I missed & where it took me very long to understand).
    - Got to learn better ways to update go module dependencies. The [PR comments](https://github.com/containerd/zfs/pull/47) from the project leads are rich with information around the same.

That's mostly what I did outside the work today. It was a busy day today (I'm happy that I was able to focus today properly).
