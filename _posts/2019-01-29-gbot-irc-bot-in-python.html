<p>Right from day one of my training in <a href="https://dgplug.org/">#dgplug</a>, I always wanted to know, "How batul, the IRC bot in #dgplug" was developed". And now today, When I myself had registered a channel #GirlScriptSnp on irc.freenode.net for conducting GirlScript Sonipat training sessions. The first thought was to just create and load a bot which was as powerful as <a href="https://github.com/kushaldas/ircbot">batul</a>. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So, now, finally, I came up with my version of batul,&nbsp;which is <strong>gbot</strong>. Unlike batul, which was entirely coded in GoLang, I have developed <strong>gbot</strong> in Python.</p>

<p>gbot is powerful than a normal(intermediate-level) IRC bot and provides a lot of options which can be expanded very easily.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Summarizing here the operations available in gbot:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Besides, connecting to a freenode-server and replying to the "PING" messages of a server with "PONG", gbot is capable of capturing/logging all the IRC messages in the console.</li>
<li>It can check whether a nick has an admin status or not.</li>
<li>If a nick has admin status, it can access various privileged commands such as #startclass and #endclass(to start and end a session, respectively, in the IRC.)</li>
<li>Besides, with admin access, a nick can add (nick #addop) or remove (nick #removeopp) operators from the channel too.</li>
<li>gbot maintains a queue of the students who are raising their hands by typing "!"  to ask their questions in the channel and call them whenever their turn shows up.</li>
<li>It can inform the participating students to wait if they try to re-queue themselves in the questions queue.</li>
<li>The mentor with admin access can answer the student's queries by typing "next" and popping out the student's nick from the question's queue in FIFO fashion.</li>
<li>gbot can also inform students when there is no session going on in the channel.</li>
<li>And lastly, as every bot can always do, it can reply with a Hello! message specifically to the nick saying "hi" to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's all for now. Looking forward to adding more functionalities into it.</p>
