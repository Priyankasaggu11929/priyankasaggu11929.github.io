<p>November 6, 2018</p>
<p>A very "Happy Choti Diwali" to all. :)Â ðŸŽ†</p>
<p>Today was a little tiring day for my brain :P . I was continuously thinking about stuff for almost half of the time.</p>
<p>Now, listing down below what I have done today.</p>
<ol>
<li>Again a focused hour devoted to Dvorak Keyboard touch type practice. Today, headed to Step-4 ie. <em>Home row + B, G, J, Q, W, X, Y, Z.Â  </em>Was able to typeÂ a paragraph ofÂ 100 words using above in approximately 16 minutes(best time for today)<b></b>.Â ðŸ˜‡</li>
<li>Woah, the Best thing of the day :D - I finally was able to write a proposal for the <a href="https://in.udacity.com/kpit-scholarship">Udacity KPIT Scholarship</a> form. This was something that took my entire day. Writing it down after thinking for hours and hours and then a quick review from a friend, ahh, made me change it many times. It was very frustrating, though the final result was worth the whole hassle.</li>
<li>I configured an Online <a href="https://feedreader.com">FeedReader</a>, subscribed to both the sites of my Mentor and thus completed the mini-project assigned to me. :) Right now, it is done for my laptop only, will try to figure it out on mobile phone also.</li>
<li>Done with entirely solving two question papers (Maths and Accountancy). Half done with CS also. :)</li>
<li>Meditation went on in the *MANDIR* inside my home today. Prayed to God for everyone's well-being. _/\_</li>
</ol>
<p>Pending include:Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â - need to work hard on Emacs and thus my Plan.org. But lagging :( .</p>
<p>Hope will complete it soon.</p>
<p>Till then, take care. o/</p>
