***Quick notes from today:***

#### `sig-auth issues & KEP review`

- To get better understanding of the work going on in around various kubernetes sig groups, I'm focusing now on **reviewing PR/issues & the KEP(s) (Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals)**. 
    - My first point of start is `sig-auth`. Although, today I went through mix set of PRs & KEPs
    - I (kind of) reviewed the following PRs from the [kubernetes/kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aopen+label%3Asig%2Fauth+sort%3Aupdated-desc) repo, which are labelled as `sig-auth`. Well, "kind of" because this is my first time reviewing k8s project PRs, rather than directly putting comments in the PRs, I collected my review notes & doubts in this [google doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekAkKUt67WH_7nYrA3imDWTFVeY69a9y1qi_fruGksg/edit?usp=sharing).
        - [[wip] Proof #101917](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101917)
        - [opt out secret-based token generation when labeled #101730](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101730)
        - [Replace x.Sub(time.Now()) with time.Until(x) #101573](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101573)
        - [deprecate apiserver.k8s.io/v1alpha1 #101571](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101571)
    - I (kind of) reviewed the following KEPs from the [kubernetes/enhancements](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr) repo:
        - [make clusterset optional](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2734)
        - [KEP-2086: update beta milestone for v1.22 #2733](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2733)
        - [KEP: Update SSA GA to 1.22](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2732)
        - [KEP-2436: wildcard and default value #2731](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2731)
        - [Updating latest-milestone to 1.22 for KEP-536 #2730](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/2730)
    - It was really really really (I can't emphasize enough) useful exercise. With this much review, I learnt a heck lot about the process followed by different sig(s) while reviewing their PR(s), what things to consider, what questions to ask, what sections to look at or verify & heck lot more. I'll keep writing more about them, as I start practising them slowly in action!
    - **Some useful links:**
        - [SIG Node Triage Process](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-node/triage.md)
        - [Where to check the status of the jobs/tests that I ran on my PRs](https://prow.k8s.io/?type=presubmit&author=Priyankasaggu11929)
        - [Kubernetes: Prow commands help](https://prow.k8s.io/command-help)
        - [How to check what are the kinds/subcommands/value-types available for a prow/bot command](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/labels?q=priority)
            - For ex: in the above ^ case it is checking what are the different kinds of the bot command `/priority`
        - [Guide to what all are the labels available & where & when do they get applied](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/label_sync/labels.md)
    - And lastly again, the elaborated review notes are in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekAkKUt67WH_7nYrA3imDWTFVeY69a9y1qi_fruGksg/edit?usp=sharing).

#### `structured-logging workgroup`

- I attended the first meeting for the `structured-logging` workgroup. This is definitely something that I'm going to work on very soon (or right away). This is a new working group being created, focusing on:
    - defining standard structure for Kubernetes log messages,
    - add methods to `klog` to enforce this structure, 
    - add ability to configure Kubernetes components to produce logs in JSON format 
    - and finally, initiate migration of kubernetes component logs to structured logging
- Action item (by myself) from today's meeting for is:
    - Thoroughly read through the [Structured Logging](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/1602-structured-logging#motivation) KEP.
    - Slowly slowly go through [these PRs for kubelet migration to structured logging](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+kubelet+structured+logging+migration)

#### `Updates on previous PRs`

- PR: [
update deployment_crud.py to include a restart_deployment method for typed client
#1452 ](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/pull/1452#discussion_r631222205) is finally merged. It was on hold from more than a week long time just because of the failing (pycodestyle script) job. Everything in the job run logs is green now. 
- And this one from yesterday, [bump containerd version to v1.5.0 (#606)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/pull/606) is also merged now.

#### `kubernetes org membership`

- And finally, last & the most wonderful thing for today (I literally danced for an hour, I mean ***literally***)
    - Finally, I created the issue for the [kubernetes organisation access](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/issues/2712) (and ofcourse, some wonderful folks have sponsered me for my membership ðŸ‘¼)
    - So, yes it is on the way but it will happen for sure (hoping before the next post itself ðŸ˜„)

That's all stuff from my day today. 

It was a work holiday (ah, although, I had on-call duties but fortunately wasn't paged at all), & I'm happy I utilised my time well (talking, working, learning, dancing & exercising. ðŸ™‚)
