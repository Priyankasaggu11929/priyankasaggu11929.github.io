December 09, 2019

**Task for the week:**

- Try to replicate the gnome-builder “search and replace bar” widget (just the wire-frame) in the Gtranslator project.

**Progress of the day:**

- I'd the first weekly meeting with my mentor, danigm[http://danigm.net], today. I presented what I did throughout the first week. Then, We had a discussion where he helped me solving the doubts from the last week's tasks and some other things (from the project) which I was not able to understand on my own.

- Later in the evening, we (all the outreachy organizers, interns & mentors) had our first zulip chat conversation. The interns shared their problems/doubts with others, seeking solutions and open guidance. The rest others shared their experience from the first week of internship. The mentors & organizers meanwhile shared some useful tips and advices which might help in ensuring smooth run of the program.

- And lastly, I finished collecting and sending all the details required by the *Software Freedom Conservancy* for initializing my internship stipends. 

Although there was no actual *working* today, but from all the time I spent talking (and listening), I have gathered some really useful pointers to start afresh from tommorow.

Till then. o/
