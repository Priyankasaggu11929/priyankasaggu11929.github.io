Recently (last month, the 27th of july),  I got a chance to speak at the [GNOME Annual Conference, GUADEC'20](https://wiki.gnome.org/GUADEC).

All thanks to [Felipe Borges](https://feborg.es/), for he *actually* organised the Intern lightning talks, for giving us (*the past & the current Outreachy & GSoC interns*) a chance to speak about our experiences throughout being a part of the community.

It was *indeed* a very warm, incredibly awesome experience getting this opportunity to share the platform, and learn from the fellow community members.

I absolutely loved it!
