*Extending on [my earlier post about the Kubernetes Release Team](https://www.psaggu.com/upstream-contribution/2021/09/03/notes.html)*

I'm serving as the **Enhancements Role Lead** for the current *Kubernetes 1.25 Release Team*.

As a role lead this time, I have a group of five outstanding shadows that I am not only mentoring to become future leads, but I am also learning from them - both _"how to teach"_ and _"how to learn"_


I haven't posted in a long time _(ups & downs & new roles & responsibilities & sometimes you don't feel like doing anything at all & it literally takes all the energy even to do the required)_

So, just adding that I was also an Enhancements Shadow on the Kubernetes 1.24 Release Team, and my former role lead, [Grace Ngyuen](https://twitter.com/gracenng), nominated me to be the next role lead at the conclusion of the previous release cycle.

When I look back on my time throughout these three cycles, I'm amazed at how much I've learned. It's been a great experience. ðŸ™‚ Not only did I learn, but I also felt recognized.

Currently, We're at Week 4 of the 1.25 release cycle, and it's one of the busiest for the Enhancements role (as we're almost approaching Enhancements Freeze in a week). I would say, we're doing good so far! ðŸ˜„

*And one more thing before I finish up this small post!*


I got to go to my first ever KubeCon event in person!

I had the opportunity to attend the KubeCon EU 2022 event in Valencia, Spain (my first ever international travel as well). I was astonished that so many people knew who I was (_anything more than zero was "so many" for me_) and that I already belonged to a tiny group of people. It was an incredible feeling.


I'm not a very photo photo person, but sharing some ðŸ™‚
