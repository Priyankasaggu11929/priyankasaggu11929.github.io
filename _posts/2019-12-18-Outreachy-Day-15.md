**Task for the week:**

- Read about Gtk Widgets and Layouts Properly.

- <strike>Try to replicate the gnome-builder “search and replace bar” widget (just the wire-frame) in the Gtranslator project.</strike>
   - <strike>[sub-task] First try doing the above task in a seperate simple application. </strike> [ON_HOLD]


**Progress of the day:**

- Yesterday, I was not able to write, so, a little from the day. I had my second weekly meeting with my mentors. We discussed the progress from last week. Danigm pointed out a lot of reading resources to fine-sharp my concepts.

- Today, I have started reading [Widgets and Layouts](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/) basics from the official documentation. Going well so far, my minor doubts are getting cleared very nice way now.


Till tomorrow. o/
