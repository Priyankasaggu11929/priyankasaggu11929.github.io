<p>November 8, 2018</p>
<blockquote><p>Voila, Today is my <strong>Mom-Dad's 28th Wedding Anniversary ðŸ’‘</strong>.</p>
<p>[gallery ids="51,50,49" type="slideshow"]</p></blockquote>
<p>This year again, we were not able to do much but got a cake via contributions made by me and siblings. Sadly, these are the time when I strongly feel like I should be earning to have lots of money(not my Daddy wala money :( ). So that I can also throw a big party like others, for my parents.</p>
<p>But then, for now, party like ^^^ is what we have for us. At least, parents were really very happy with the preparations :) .</p>
<p>Now, for the logs.</p>
<p>Ah, haven't done anything but was busy doing small-small preparations for today's "Chota-Sa" party.</p>
<p>And yup, that's it for today. Will try to have more tomorrow.</p>
<p>Till then, take care. o/</p>
