## Introduction

The following document demonstrates the steps followed while adding a new validation check in the upstream [**kube-linter**](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter) project.

> KubeLinter is a static analysis tool that checks Kubernetes YAML files and Helm charts to ensure the applications represented in them adhere to best practices.

> <sub>*[kube-linter GitHub Project](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter)*</sub>

This document uses the static check [**`latest-tag`**](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/tree/main/pkg/templates/latesttag), as an example to lay down the steps written below.

> The `latest-tag` validation check indicates when a deployment-like kubernetes object (i.e. deployments, statefulsets, etc) is running a container with an invalid container image (by default, flags for a floating image tag like "latest")


## Steps to add a new check

---

**[STEP 1] Setup the project on your local machine**

- Clone the project repository & change directory to the project root

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:stackrox/kube-linter.git
  
  cd kube-linter/
  ```

**[STEP 2] Setup a new directory for the new validation check**

- From the root of the project, change directory to the `pkg/templates/` folder

  ```
  cd pkg/templates
  ```

- Create a new directory with the name corresponding to the new check (for example, in this case, [`latesttag`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/tree/main/pkg/templates/latesttag))

  ```
  mkdir latesttag
  
  cd latesttag/
  ```

**[STEP 3] Implement the logic for the new check under the new directory**

- Create the following files & folders in the path `pkg/templates/latesttag/`
  
  ```
  mkdir -p internal/params
  
  touch internal/prarms/params.go
  
  touch template.go template_test.go
  ```
  
- The above files can be understood as (& referred from):
  
    - **internal/params/params.go**

          
      The [`internal/params/params.go`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/blob/main/pkg/templates/latesttag/internal/params/params.go) file will contain the paramaters required for the test check. 
      
    - **template.go**

       The actual implementation logic for the new test check will be written in the [`template.go`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/blob/main/pkg/templates/latesttag/template.go) file.
       
    - **template_test.go**
       
      And finally, the unit tests to validate the new check logic will be written in [`template_test.go`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/blob/main/pkg/templates/latesttag/template_test.go) file


**[STEP 4] Make the new check visible to kube-linter**

- From the root of the project, modify the [`pkg/templates/all/all.go`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/blob/main/pkg/templates/all/all.go) file to include the path to our new test, i.e. `pkg/templates/latesttag`

  ```
  vim pkg/templates/all/all.go
  ```
  
- And modify the file to look like following:
  
  ```go
  package all

  import (
    // Import all check templates.
    ...
    _ "golang.stackrox.io/kube-linter/pkg/templates/latesttag"
    ...
  )
  ```

**[STEP 5] Include the new check as a kube-linter builtin check**

- From the root of the project, go to the `pkg/builtin-checks/yamls` folder & make a new yaml file corresponding to the name of the new check, (for example, [`latest-tag.yaml`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/blob/main/pkg/builtinchecks/yamls/latest-tag.yaml)).

  ```
  vim latest-tag.yaml
  ```

- And edit the file to look like following:
  
  ```yaml
  name: "latest-tag"
  description: "Indicates when a deployment-like object is running a container with an invalid container image"
  remediation: "Use a container image with a proper image tag satisfying the \"AllowList\" & \"BlockList\" regex patterns."
  scope:
    objectKinds:
      - DeploymentLike
  template: "latest-tag"
  params:
    BlockList: [".*:(latest)$"]
    AllowList: []
  ```

- The `latest-tag.yaml` file does the following:

    - provide self-explanatory string values for `name`, `description` & `remediation` fields
    - define the scope of the check, using the following block

      ```yaml
      scope:
        objectKinds:
          - DeploymentLike
      ```

    - references the new test check template (defined at [`pkg/templates/latesttag/template.go`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/blob/main/pkg/templates/latesttag/template.go)), for example, `template: "latest-tag"`
    - provides default paramaeter values required by the check validation logic (defined at [`pkg/templates/latesttag/internal/params/params.go`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/blob/main/pkg/templates/latesttag/internal/params/params.go))

      ```yaml
      params:
        BlockList: [".*:(latest)$"]
        AllowList: []
      ```

**`(Optional)` [STEP 6] Include the new check as a kube-linter default built-in check**

- So far, the new check is just a **builtin check**, and is not a **default check** yet (i.e. kube-linter won't run this check by default unless specified)

    - In order to add the new check as a kube-linter default check:

    Edit the [`internal/defaultchecks/defaultcheck.go`](https://github.com/stackrox/kube-linter/blob/main/internal/defaultchecks/default_checks.go) file & add the new check name, to look like the following:

    ```go
    package defaultchecks

    import (
      "golang.stackrox.io/kube-linter/internal/set"
    )

    var (
      // List is the list of built-in checks that are enabled by default.
      List = set.NewFrozenStringSet(
        ...
        "latest-tag",
        ...
      )
    )
    ```
   
Once everything above is done, the next step is to test the the newly added check!


## Steps to verify the new check

---

**[STEP 1] Build the kube-linter binary from the local project source code.**

 The local kube-linter binary will contain the new check `latest-tag`

- Run the following command:

  ```
  make generated-srcs
  ```

- And the output would look something like:

  ```
  ❯ make generated-srcs 
  go generate ./...
  Compiling Go source in ./cmd/kube-linter to bin/darwin/kube-linter
  Compiling Go source in ./cmd/kube-linter to bin/linux/kube-linter
  Compiling Go source in ./cmd/kube-linter to bin/windows/kube-linter.exe
  kube-linter templates list --format markdown > docs/generated/templates.md
  kube-linter checks list --format markdown > docs/generated/checks.md
  ```

  The above command generate local kube-linter binary (for linux, windows & macOS), along with all other auto-generated check templates & markdown documentation required by the kube-linter command line binary tooling to interact with.


**[STEP 2] Create an example static yaml manifest**

- As the new check `latest-tag` (we're adding as part of this documentation), is defined for a scope of `DeploymentLike` object, I'm creating an example deployment manifest yaml to do the testing.

- At the root of the project, create an `examples` directory & put a `deployment.yaml` file under it (as our test deployment yaml manifest):

  ```
  mkdir examples

  cd examples/

  vim deployment.yaml
  ```

  Edit the `deployment.yaml` file to look like the following:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apps/v1
  kind: Deployment
  metadata:
    name: nginx-deployment
    labels:
      app: nginx
  spec:
    replicas: 2
    selector:
      matchLabels:
        app: nginx
    template:
      metadata:
        labels:
          app: nginx
      spec:
        containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: example.com/test:v1.0.0
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
        - name: frontend
          image: quay.io/django:latest
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8000
        - name: key-value-store
          image: docker.io/redis:v1.4.1
          ports:
          - containerPort: 6379
  ```
    
**[STEP 3] Test the new check with the above example static yaml manifest**

- Execute the following command to run all the kube-linter checks on the test `deployment.yaml` manifest

  ```
  /bin/linux/kube-linter lint examples/deployment.yaml
  ```

- In case, you want to run just the newly added `latest-tag` check, execute the following command:

  ```
  /bin/linux/kube-linter lint --do-not-include-builtin-checks --include latest-tag examples/deployment.yaml
  ```

- And the output would look something like this:

  ```
  ❯ ./bin/linux/kube-linter lint /examples/deployment.yaml 
  KubeLinter 0.2.2-6-gc65dd74013-dirty

  examples/deployment.yaml: (object: <no namespace>/nginx-deployment apps/v1, Kind=Deployment) The container "nginx" is using an invalid container image, "example.com/test:v1.0.0". Please use images that satisfies the `AllowList` criteria : ["^(docker.io)"] (check: latest-tag, remediation: Use a container image with a proper image tag satisfying the "AllowList" & "BlockList" regex patterns.)

  examples/deployment.yaml: (object: <no namespace>/nginx-deployment apps/v1, Kind=Deployment) The container "frontend" is using an invalid container image, "quay.io/django:latest". Please use images that are not blocked by the `BlockList` criteria : [".*:(latest)$"] (check: latest-tag, remediation: Use a container image with a proper image tag satisfying the "AllowList" & "BlockList" regex patterns.)
  ...
  ```
   
**[STEP 4] Verify the unit tests & the E2E (end-to-end) tests**

- Run the following command from the root of the project

  ```
  make test
  
  make e2e-test
  ```

**[STEP 5] Lint the project**

- Run the following command from the root of the project to lint the project source code

  ```
  make lint
  ```

And finally, when you're happy with how the new check performs, please raise a PR for the upstream `kube-linter` project & wait for a review! 🙂
