I'm struggling for a title, for these daily blogs. If you've any suggestions, please please tell me 😅 (I'm very serious). I want to eliminate this title thinking part.

***Anyways, updates from today:***

- Today was kind of a leisure day. kind of only, because I literally troubled myself with the feeling that I was supposed to work today but I didn't work. I need to improve here alot.

- I bought my first ever domain name ([psaggu.com](blog.psaggu.com)). Ah, I still did lots of thinking (cough cough ***over-thinking***) on deciding, whether I should buy or not, or why I should buy, or what I will use it for, etc etc. But, tl;dr I bought it & now this blog is live on [blog.psaggu.com](blog.psaggu.com). It was a good exercise for me, understanding how to create DNS records.

- To make all my social media handles, cohesvibe with the new domain name, I changed/updated the twitter username (to @_psaggu), linkedIn (to psaggu) & gnome gitlab username (to psaggu) handles. Well, Github is still left, & I'm not sure what all things it will break if I update it right now. Lots of trouble & risk, so leaving it for later.

- I re-wrote the blog's [about](https://blog.psaggu.com/about.html) page. I think I can be very ok with this one for quite some time now. :)

- I finished some pending phone calls (family & friends).

- (Just right now) I also finished filling up the survery for my DO280 training course (yes, that counts as work).

- And I wrote this post. (title, title, please suggest me title)

That's all for today, Tata everyone. Good night!
