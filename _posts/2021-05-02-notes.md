Notes from today:

- Worked on the following two issues:
    - [how to get namespaces ingressroutes through #1388](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues/1388)
        - PR ready, I'm just waiting for one of my yesterday's PR to get merged first, so, I could add solution to this as well, on top of that.
    - [How do we do rolling restart? #1378](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/issues/1378)
        - PR here ~ https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/pull/1450

- Spent some time going through open issues (& lots of closed, and stale issues & old PRs) on the k8s python client repo. And I would say, I can read them (in terms of what they're asking for), I have my set of terminilogies in place now. But not to deny, there is no difference in my getting extremely overwhelmed by the stuff all around there. And then I ask myself how much time & effort, I have spent so far? And was I able to pick up this much stuff even before? Was I able to understand the context of the problems/issues/PRs before? Was I aware of the project structure (the little I know even now)? Was I even here & doing this before? And answers to all these questions, give me hope to keep going. Because I'm learning & I'm learning a lot. And, this is not a competition for me with others but definitely my own obligation with myself, to everyday show up & try. So, I'll do it.

That's it. 

(And a note to myself, next time weekend should be mostly weekends. You really need them.)
