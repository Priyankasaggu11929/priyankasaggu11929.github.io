December 07, 2019

**Task for the week:**

- Understand the structure and working of [libdazzle's example application](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libdazzle/blob/master/examples/app).

**Progress of the day:**

- Going slow and steady now. :)

- I finished going through the flatpak's [Getting started](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/index.html) documentation.

- Next, I have started with [Quickstart guide for Using Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html). Will take some more time to finish (and understad).

## Misc (not related to outreachy):

- I saw [kushal's toot](https://toots.dgplug.org/web/statuses/103266106665804488) stating the addition of another Pymbook chapter for [learning hardware simulation (based on Adafruit Circuit Playground express)](https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hardwaresimulation.html) using CircuitPython. And I couldn't resist giving it a try. So, spent some time playing with the setup in the evening.

That's all for the day.

Be back on monday. o/
