**Task for the week:**

- <strike>Understand the structure and working of libdazzle’s example application.</strike> [Finished]

- Try to replicate the gnome-builder “search and replace bar” widget (just the wire-frame) in the Gtranslator project.

**Progress of the day:**

- I finished setting up and building the [libdazzle’s example application](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libdazzle/blob/master/examples/app).
What I learnt from the process:
  - How to setup a GNOME project structure from scratch.
  - How to write *meson.build* files for simple projects from scratch.
  - How & where to add external dependencies for the project (in either case when the application has *flatpak manifests* or just *meson.build* files).
  - And lastly, how to make sure the project is installable.
