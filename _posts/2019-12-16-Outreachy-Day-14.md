December 16, 2019

**Task for the week:**

- Try to replicate the gnome-builder “search and replace bar” widget (just the wire-frame) in the Gtranslator project.
  - [sub-task] First try doing the above task in a seperate simple application.

**Progress of the day:**

- A usual long day of struggle with the code (and even the build process and some Python script errors). Everything's at the same level. No much progress today. But yeah, at the end of the day, received a whole array of pointers (resources) from my mentor to work on tommorow.


That's all for today.

Till tomorrow. o/
