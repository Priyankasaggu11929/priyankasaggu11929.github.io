**Disclaimer:**  

_Just trying to document the process (strictly) for me._

_This documentation is just for educational purpose._

_**The process won't follow for any production cluster!**_

## Aim

To upgrade a Kubernetes cluster with nodes running Kubernetes Version v1.26.4 to v1.27.2

I'm using a Kubernetes cluster created using Kind, for the example sake.

### [STEP 1] Create a kind Kubernetes cluster

Use the following `kind-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
# three node (two workers) cluster config
kind: Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  image: kindest/node:v1.26.4@sha256:f4c0d87be03d6bea69f5e5dc0adb678bb498a190ee5c38422bf751541cebe92e
- role: worker
  image: kindest/node:v1.26.4@sha256:f4c0d87be03d6bea69f5e5dc0adb678bb498a190ee5c38422bf751541cebe92e
```

Please note:
- The above config file for Kind cluster will create a Kubernetes cluster with 2 nodes:
    - Control Plane Node (name: kind-control-plane)
      Kubernetes Version: v1.26.4
    - Worker Node (name: kind-worker)
      Kubernetes Version: v1.26.4
      
**Run the following command to create the cluster:**

```bash
$ kind create cluster --config kind-config.yaml 
Creating cluster "kind" ...
 ‚úì Ensuring node image (kindest/node:v1.26.4) üñº
 ‚úì Preparing nodes üì¶ üì¶  
 ‚úì Writing configuration üìú 
 ‚úì Starting control-plane üïπÔ∏è 
 ‚úì Installing CNI üîå 
 ‚úì Installing StorageClass üíæ 
 ‚úì Joining worker nodes üöú 
Set kubectl context to "kind-kind"
You can now use your cluster with:

kubectl cluster-info --context kind-kind

Have a question, bug, or feature request? Let us know! https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/#community üôÇ
```

**Verify if cluster came up successfully:**

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE                         KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME
kind-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   2m43s   v1.26.4   172.18.0.3    <none>        Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.21
kind-worker          Ready    <none>          2m25s   v1.26.4   172.18.0.2    <none>        Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.21

```

Note that the version of both nodes is currently `v1.26.4`

---

### [STEP 2] Upgrade the control plane node

**Exec inside the docker container corresponding to the control plane node (kind-control-plane):**

```bash
$ docker exec -it kind-control-plane bash

root@kind-control-plane:/# 
```

**Install the utility packages:**

```bash
root@kind-control-plane:/# apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl gnupg
root@kind-control-plane:/# curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
root@kind-control-plane:/# cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
root@kind-control-plane:/# apt-get update
```

**Check which version to upgrade to (in our case, we're checking if v1.27.2 is available)**

```bash
root@kind-control-plane:/# apt-cache madison kubeadm

  kubeadm |  1.27.2-00 | http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
  kubeadm |  1.27.1-00 | http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
  kubeadm |  1.27.0-00 | http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
  kubeadm |  1.26.5-00 | http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
  kubeadm |  1.26.4-00 | http://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial/main amd64 Packages
  ...
```

**Upgrade Kubeadm to the required version:**

```bash
root@kind-control-plane:/# apt-mark unhold kubeadm && apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.27.2-00 && apt-mark hold kubeadm

...

Configuration file '/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf'
 ==> File on system created by you or by a script.
 ==> File also in package provided by package maintainer.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.

```

**I'm skipping upgrading the CNI** (I don't have any additional CNI provider plugin, other than what defaults to Kind cluster ~ [kindnet](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/tree/main/images/kindnetd))

But if you need to check how kindnet is working, do following inside the control plane node:

```bash
root@kind-control-plane:/# crictl ps

```

Now, before we go and upgrade the kubelet & kubectl (& restart the services), 

**Open a new terminal (outside the docker exec) and mark the node unschedulable (cordon) and then evict the workload (drain)**

```bash
# Outside the docker exec terminal
$ kubectl drain kind-control-plane --ignore-daemonsets

node/kind-control-plane cordoned
Warning: ignoring DaemonSet-managed Pods: kube-system/kindnet-blltq, kube-system/kube-proxy-rfbd5

$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

kind-worker          Ready                      <none>          47m   v1.26.4   172.18.0.2    <none>        Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.21

```

**Now, come back to the former terminal with the docker exec (into control-plane node):**

**And upgrade the kubelet and kubectl:**

```bash
root@kind-control-plane:/# apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet=1.27.2-00 kubectl=1.27.2-00 && apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl

kubelet is already the newest version (1.27.2-00).
kubelet set to manually installed.

kubelet set on hold.
```

**And now restart the kubelet:**

```bash
root@kind-control-plane:/# systemctl daemon-reload
root@kind-control-plane:/# systemctl restart kubelet
```

**And now go back to the other terminal outside the docker exec, and uncordon the node:**

```bash
$ kubectl uncordon kind-control-plane

node/kind-control-plane uncordoned
```

And that's everything for the control plane upgrade! Just check at last if it is running properly!

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE                         KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME
kind-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   52m   v1.27.2   172.18.0.3    <none>        Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.21

```

**And don't forget to exit from the docker exec terminal (kind-control-plane):**

```bash
root@kind-control-plane:/# exit
exit
```

---

### [STEP 3] Upgrade the worker node

**Exec inside the docker container corresponding to the worker node (kind-worker):**

```bash
$ docker exec -it kind-worker bash
root@kind-worker:/# 
```

**Install the utility packages:**

```bash
root@kind-worker:/#  apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl gnupg
root@kind-worker:/#  curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -
root@kind-worker:/#  cat <<EOF >/etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
EOF
root@kind-worker:/#  apt-get update

**Upgrade Kubeadm to the required version:**

```bash
root@kind-worker:/# apt-mark unhold kubeadm && apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.27.2-00 && apt-mark hold kubeadm

...
Setting up kubeadm (1.27.2-00) ...

Configuration file '/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf'
 ==> File on system created by you or by a script.
 ==> File also in package provided by package maintainer.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** 10-kubeadm.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? Y
Installing new version of config file /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf ...
kubeadm set on hold.
```

**Run kubeadm upgrade (For worker nodes this upgrades the local kubelet configuration):**

```bash
root@kind-worker:/# kubeadm upgrade node

[upgrade] Reading configuration from the cluster...
[upgrade] FYI: You can look at this config file with 'kubectl -n kube-system get cm kubeadm-config -o yaml'
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks
[preflight] Skipping prepull. Not a control plane node.
[upgrade] Skipping phase. Not a control plane node.
[upgrade] Backing up kubelet config file to /etc/kubernetes/tmp/kubeadm-kubelet-config2909228160/config.yaml
[kubelet-start] Writing kubelet configuration to file "/var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml"
[upgrade] The configuration for this node was successfully updated!
[upgrade] Now you should go ahead and upgrade the kubelet package using your package manager.
```

Now, before we go and upgrade the kubelet & kubectl (& restart the services), 

**Open a new terminal (outside the docker exec of kind-worker container) and mark the node unschedulable (cordon) and then evict the workload (drain)**

```bash
# Outside the docker exec terminal
$ kubectl drain kind-worker --ignore-daemonsets

node/kind-worker cordoned

$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

```

**Now, come back to the former terminal with the docker exec (into kind-worker container):**

**And upgrade the kubelet and kubectl:**

```bash
root@kind-control-plane:/# apt-mark unhold kubelet kubectl && apt-get update && apt-get install -y kubelet=1.27.2-00 kubectl=1.27.2-00 && apt-mark hold kubelet kubectl

kubectl was already not hold.

kubectl set on hold.
```

**And now restart the kubelet:**

```bash
root@kind-worker:/# systemctl daemon-reload
root@kind-worker:/# systemctl restart kubelet
```

**And now go back to the other terminal outside the docker exec, and uncordon the node:**

```bash
$ kubectl uncordon kind-worker

node/kind-worker uncordoned
```

And that's everything for the worker node upgrade! Just check at last if it is running properly!

```bash
$ kubectl get nodes -o wide
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE                         KERNEL-VERSION      CONTAINER-RUNTIME

kind-worker          Ready    <none>          66m   v1.27.2   172.18.0.2    <none>        Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)   5.15.0-73-generic   containerd://1.6.21
```

**And don't forget to exit from the docker exec terminal (kind-worker):**

```bash
root@kind-worker:/# exit
exit
```

With that both our nodes are now successfully upgraded from Kubernetes version v1.26.4 to v1.27.2
