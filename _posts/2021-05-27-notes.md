***Quick notes from today:***

#### `walk-through of the k8s prow jobs testgrid`

*[The meeting notes are in this [google document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekAkKUt67WH_7nYrA3imDWTFVeY69a9y1qi_fruGksg/edit?usp=sharing)]*

- During today's 1:1 Thursday meeting with dims, he very kindly walked me through the **testGrid for different prow ci job** under the k8s project. 
- Below are most of the things (I guess all, if I'm really not missing any more) that I learnt: 
     - How to point to the prow job results dashboard from a PR. 
         - Look for the list of the prow tests at the bottom of the PR, pick one prow job & click on the `Details` button next to it. For ex, [this one](https://prow.k8s.io/view/gs/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-logs/pull/102332/pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind/1397528065768165376) goes to prow job `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind` outcomes for this [PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102332).
     - From there, I walked through all the following tabs on the prow job dashboard:
         - [`Job History`](https://prow.k8s.io/job-history/gs/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-logs/directory/pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind): lists all the previous runs of a particular job across PRs under different k8s projects, with their statuses, whether failed or passed or skipped or else.
         - [`Prow Job YAML`](https://prow.k8s.io/prowjob?prowjob=c2ea64e1-be1c-11eb-ade9-d23ecbe60be7): shows the k8s yaml manifest for a particular prow ci job
         - [`PR History`](https://prow.k8s.io/pr-history?org=kubernetes&repo=kubernetes&pr=102332): Lists outcome of all the prow jobs/tests runs (not for a particular one job) on a particular PR across it's different commits
         - [`PR`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/102332): takes back to the PR from where we started
         - [`Artifacts`](https://gcsweb.k8s.io/gcs/kubernetes-jenkins/pr-logs/pull/102332/pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind/1397528065768165376/): directory containing a rich compilation of all the logs & artifacts that were created during a particular prow job run
         - [`Testgrid`](https://testgrid.k8s.io/presubmits-kubernetes-blocking#pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind): looks like the screenshot below. I need to play around it more to write a better minimal explanation for this, but what I understand right now is, it is same as `Job History` but with a tile (or a graph) representation distributed across differnet time periods (if it's a periodic jobs) for when the job was executed & wha were the results of those runs (success, failure or skipped). The job results are in a compact grid structure, so it becomes easier to do retrospective on the performance of a particular job for a really long period of time in one screen itself.

           <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30499743/119876626-b6798d00-bf45-11eb-8ce3-52252fa885eb.png" alt="K8s-prow-job-testgrid" width="800"/>
     - Followed by that, I learnt how I could utilize [`cs.k8s.io`](https://cs.k8s.io) (or Hound) to fetch both the job configuration & corresponding testgrid configuration for a particular prow job (for ex, here is for this job ~ [`ci-cri-containerd-node-e2e`](https://cs.k8s.io/?q=ci-cri-containerd-node-e2e&i=nope&files=&excludeFiles=&repos=kubernetes/test-infra)
     - And lastly, I learnt about different types of prow jobs under k8s projects. The ones I learnt today (not sure if these are the only ones) are:
         - `Periodic jobs` ~ runs over a defined period of time, say over every 5 hours, etc.
         - `Pre-submit jobs` ~ the CI jobs which are required to be green for a PR to be merged. Pre-submit here means this job is a pre-submit check for a PR.
         - `On-demand jobs` ~ the CI jobs that are expensive to run periodically & are not common to most of the PRs. Can be initiated using a prow test flag in the PR commaents, for ex ~ [`/test pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind`](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/101571#issuecomment-828304420).
- Exercise for the coming week (Testgrid exercise)
     - Pick up one PR -> Pick up one prow job
     - Investigate how that prow job is defined, whether it is `periodic` or `pre-submit` or an `on-demand` job
     - Investiage the results of a prow job run, so check & understand the following:
         - the artifacts created by the job run
         - logs it produced across various components

#### `bi-weekly structured-logging workgroup meeting`

- Today was the second meeting for the `structured-logging` working group.
- It was a wonderful discussion, touching progress on all following areas:
    - How the Workgroup work would be organised?
        - new label under all k8s projects ~ `wg/structured-logging-label` (apply it as `/wg structured-logging`
        - teams ~ interested folks could add themselves as either `member` or `reviewer` to the project based on their understanding. `member` is open to everyone, `reviewer` is for folks having prior skills & experiebce.
        - I've added myself as a [member](https://github.com/kubernetes/org/pull/2739) currently.
    - Updates on the status of work in areas:
        - Retrospection of kubelet migration (a survery is passed through the teams/people who participated in the migration process as code-contributots, reviewers, approvers etc)
        - Structured logging is well tested to check correctness and prevent regressions
        - Verification of log volumes (discussed as one of the major concerns)
        - Graduate JSON format to Beta
    - As part of the retrospective on the kubelet logs migration, the following point was reflected:
        -  Lack of plural support in case of log key names
        -  The proposed solution is to implement the plural imitations of the existing `klog.KObj`, `klog.KRef` methods. I've picked up to do the same.
        -  I've current not much idea on how it would be implemented. I'll start by looking at the [previous singular implementation here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/kubernetes/klog/pull/128/files&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1622144426669000&usg=AOvVaw37UBoMSF4M4ymn-qgwQiw5).
        -  Will also read through the [discussion that reflected the issue](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/99799#discussion_r588252534)
