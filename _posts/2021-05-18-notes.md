***Quick notes from today:***

#### `hacking DVO`

DVO aka [Deployment Validation Operator](https://github.com/app-sre/deployment-validation-operator) is an openshift-sdk based operator, which checks deployments and other resources against a curated collection of best practices. Some folks from Red Hat's AppSRE team are working on building this operator. This is majorly a work in progress currently, & I'm trying to getting involved in this quite early itself. As part of my getting onboarded, I spent couple of hours in the morning hacking the existing implemenation & below is what I did:
- I've deployed the DVO operator on a local code-ready-container (crc) cluster.
- I can see the gauge metrics in one of the dvo-operator pod logs.
    ![Screenshot from 2021-05-18 12-23-48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30499743/118699201-e41c5300-b82e-11eb-98a3-70b07aac84ff.png)
- I spent time reading the code under the [deployment-validation-operator/pkg](https://github.com/app-sre/deployment-validation-operator/tree/master/pkg), more specifically the validation tests. What I understood there, is:
    - [replicas_test.go](https://github.com/app-sre/deployment-validation-operator/blob/master/pkg/validations/replicas_test.go) is analogous to `dv_replicas` gauge metrics.
    - [requests_limits_test.go](https://github.com/app-sre/deployment-validation-operator/blob/master/pkg/validations/requests_limits_test.go) is analogous to `dv_requests_limits` gauge metrics.
- I had a question:
    - The gauge metrics `dv_replicas` & `dv_requests_limits` , are these being exported to Prometheus with the help of some exporter, when I deploy DVO? I was not able to query them on Prometheus. Maybe I'm unable to understand something here?
    - Just got the following answer:
    > DVO generates them but to see them in prometheus via the prometheus operator, you would need to create a "service monitor" in the namespace of the prometheus operator.
    > At least, that‚Äôs how app-sre has that setup. It's because the prometheus operator we deploy, doesn‚Äôt find the "service monitors" in any namespace except its own.  I suspect that may be the case for crc as well.
- And, I'm yet to try doing this part ~ ***making DVO run on top of kube-linter.***

### `kubernetes/website issues review/triage`

I triaged/reviewed the following 4 issues from the [kubernetes/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) project. (& a lot more actually. I didn't include because there was not any action on them from me):
- [Issue with k8s.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/kubeadm/kubeadm-certs/ #27931](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/27931)
    - For this one, I raised a PR as well ~ [fix the kubelet-config-1.21 configmap key value from config to kubelet #28025](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/28025). It's labelled `lgtm` now.
- [Last command of "Interactive Tutorial - Exposing Your App" interactive lesson is deprecated #27056](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/27056#issuecomment-843129207)
- [List All Container Images Running in a Cluster (#27475)](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/27475#issuecomment-843066458)
- [Unclear requirements for ‚ÄúUsing Source IP‚Äù tutorial #27162](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/27162#issuecomment-843223669)

### `sharing good-first-issues with folks in community`

I shared the last two issues (I mentioned above) in the kubernetes `in-dev` slack channel, after I was done prepping them with the solutions. The only thing I left for the folks attempting, was to right away implement it. Well, people might call it *spoon feeding* (which I *myself* am totally against of). But the fact is, the kubernetes project has become really complex that the entry barrier has become more emotionally overwhelming, if not anything else. So, yea, that's what I did today, tried to help someone getting started. Alteast making it easy for two of the folks to start. 

It made me really happy. I recalled *[jason braganza](https://janusworx.com)* telling me, that ***paying it forward is the only way to paying it back***. I'm trying to do it. üôÇ

### `Kubernetes sig-security Tooling meeting`

Attended the very first meeting of a new sub-group/working-group under `sig-security`. This new sub-group is known as `sig-security-tooling`. Today's meeting was more of an introduction to the project charter, setting up expectations & making everyone comfortable by discussing what could be different ways to get involved. I'll follow up with the coming updates on the project & wherever I'll get opportunities, I'll definitely contribute back. But it was lovely talking to some wonderful folks like ***Tabitha Sable***, ***Pushkar Joglekar*** and so many others.

### `hacking client-generator code`

I'm currently trying to learn, how I can generate the entire `kubernetes-python/client` source code from scratch. I tried with the following so far:
- I tried hacking the [kubernetes-client/gen](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen) tool.
- Following the `README` doc for the client generator, I attempted the stuff below:
    - Cloned the `kubernetes-client/gen` repo & ran the following command inside the cloned repo ~
        - `./openapi/python.sh python-client/ settings-file.sh`
            - where `python-client` is the output directory.
            - `settings-file.sh` has these content inside it ~
               - `export KUBERNETES_BRANCH="master" export CLIENT_VERSION="v17.17.0" export PACKAGE_NAME="client"`

- But building this ended up in the following error:

```
Step 26/26 : ENTRYPOINT ["mvn-entrypoint.sh", "/generate_client.sh"]
 ---> Using cache
 ---> bd1d3efce8aa

  InsecureRequestWarning)
Error downloading spec file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psaggu/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json. Reason: Not Found
```
- As I can see from the error message, it is because :
    - In the spec file url ~ [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psaggu/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/psaggu/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json), it is looking for the `swagger.json` file, in a kubernetes repo fork under some GitHub username, `psaggu`.
    - But in my case it is, [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Priyankasaggu11929/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Priyankasaggu11929/kubernetes/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json)
- I discussed this with [Haowei Kai](https://github.com/roycaihw), one of the project leads & he suggested the following:
    - The simpler way to do it is, trying using the [kubernetes-client/python/scripts/update-client.sh](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/blob/master/scripts/update-client.sh), which is how we generate the python client. It builds on top of the client-gen repo. It basically set the configuration for you.
    - And for the issue I had above, this line controls that ~ [kubernetes-client/gen/openapi/openapi-generator/client-generator.sh#L52](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/gen/blob/65a1e4739cf0dcc2b93f887d33fe0ad3772b6169/openapi/openapi-generator/client-generator.sh#L52). For username (that was coming in the spec file error above), it reads from the `USERNAME` env, so maybe I have to set it in my shell & try again.

That's all for the day! It was a wonderful day today. üôè
