June 10, 2021

*(Thursdays are the weekly 1:1 meetings with dims. You could find the [agenda document here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekAkKUt67WH_7nYrA3imDWTFVeY69a9y1qi_fruGksg/edit?usp=sharing))*

Today's meeting was a discussion in continuation to this *[previous blog, where I wrote about dims giving me a walkthrough of the k8s testgrid dashboard](https://www.psaggu.com/upstream-contribution/2021/05/27/notes.html)*.

As a takeaway, I had left for myself a home-work exercise in the end of that discussion. Below is where I'm trying to take notes of what I learnt broadly after doing that homework exercise.

And yea, the homework was to explore what I learnt about the kubernetes testgrid (above), now through the source code.

---

- The source code for the kubernetes CI test jobs are present in this repository here ~ **[kubernetes/test-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra)**

- There are broadly the following three types of CI test jobs in the kubernetes project ~
   - Pre-submit jobs
   - Post-submit jobs
   - Periodic jobs

- For the purpose of note taking, let's start by taking the **Pre-submit** jobs as our example usecase.

  *( `Here is something important to know (which is also the reason why I'm picking Pre-submit jobs for our example):`*

  *Only the `Pre-submit` CI jobs have this properly defined & maintained dashboard. You would not find a similar testgrid dashboard (something that we are going to discuss below in the notes) for the `Post-submit` jobs or `Periodic` jobs. Following being the major reasons:*
  
  - *The `Pre-submit jobs` are the kind of jobs that runs everytime before a PR is submitted or merged. So, it contains mostly blocking jobs. And because these are blocking jobs & run on almost all the PRs during a day, we want the number of these jobs to be very less. And thus, the effort of maintaining a dashboard for these limited number of `pre-submit` jobs sound reasonabe & quite doable.*
  - *On the other hand, the number of `Periodic jobs` & `Post-submit jobs` is very high, & currently most of these are frequently ending up failing only. So, the dashboard usually end up being all red. People argue that these jobs fail so often & so much, that maybe the evaluation/validation criteria of these jobs are not good enough & so, no use of maintaining an all time red board for this large number of jobs.  )*

  That being said, now we could start exploring things in action.

- Head onto the kubenetes CI jobs testgrid dashboard groups UI using this link ~ [https://testgrid.k8s.io](https://testgrid.k8s.io).
  
  You will find something like following ~
  
  ![Screenshot from 2021-06-10 22-51-21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30499743/121569472-71be1d80-ca3e-11eb-9be7-2a251978d68d.png)


  All these tiles such as `conformance`, `gardener`, `google`, ... , `presubmits`, ... , `wg-multi-tenancy` corresponds to a set of CI jobs dashboards or a dashboard-group (as we call it in the source-code), for a specific project or a sig-group.
  
  The source-code corresponding to all these dashboard-group tiles (shown in the above screenshot) sits here ~ [kubernetes/test-infra/config/testgrids](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/config/testgrids)

- For our example, as I mentioned above, we are checking `presubmits` dashboard-group.

  The [kubernetes testgrid dashboard-group for `Pre-submit jobs`](https://testgrid.k8s.io/presubmits) (as of my writing this blog) looks like the following ~

  ![Screenshot from 2021-06-10 22-42-07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30499743/121568532-6cac9e80-ca3d-11eb-80c6-d327fde6e24b.png)

  You'll see in the top left corner, a `grid-like` icon. Clicking that `grid-like` icon would take you back to the [same list of `dashboard-groups` home page UI](https://testgrid.k8s.io) as we discussed in the last point above.

  Now, on this [`pre-submits` dashboard-group](https://testgrid.k8s.io/presubmits) page, we see all these tabs (or the similar row entries under `dashboard` column in the **`Dashboard Group presubmits :: Overview`** table) ~ 
  
  `presubmits-alibaba-cloud-csi-driver`, `presubmits-cloud-provider-alibaba`, ... , `presubmits-test-infra`
  
  These tabs corresponds to the dashboards that goes under our `presubmits` dashboard-group. And of course, these dashboard tabs will further divide into CI jobs (as we'll see later in the notes).
  
  Before we move further, it's also interesting to look at the information provided in the **`Dashboard Group presubmits :: Overview`** table.
  
  As we can see, there are three columns:
     - `Status`, 
     - `Dashboard` (which is basically list of names of the dashboard such as `presubmits-alibaba-cloud-csi-driver`, ... , etc.), 
     - `Health`
  
  This table gives a broader view of how many CI jobs under a certain dashboard are `PASSING`, or `FAILING`, or are there any `FLAKY` jobs. For ex, in case of dashboard [`presubmits-kubernetes-nonblocking`](https://testgrid.k8s.io/presubmits-kubernetes-nonblocking) (from the above screenshot),
      
     - The overall status of this dashboard is `FAILING` (because we see there is atleast one CI job failing)
     - There are 6 `PASSING` CI jobs, 15 `FLAKY` CI jobs, & 1 `FAILING` CI job.

  The source-code corresponding to this `presubmits` dashboard-group sits here ~ [kubernetes/test-infra/config/testgrids/kubernetes/presubmits/config.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/config/testgrids/kubernetes/presubmits/config.yaml)
  
- Let's try to break this `presubmits/config.yaml` file (I linked just above).

  - The following two lines in the very beginning of the config file, tells us about the name of the `dashboard-group` it corresponds to.
    
    So, in this as we can see, this config file corresponds to `presubmits` dashboard-group.
  
    ```yaml
    dashboard_groups:
    - name: presubmits
    ```

  - further down, this section `dashboard_names` tells us about what all dashboards are included as tabs in the `presubmits` dashboard-group.
  
    As we could match from the above screenshot, all the dashboard tabs we could see there, are listed under this section.

    ```yaml
    dashboard_names:
    - presubmits-alibaba-cloud-csi-driver
    - presubmits-cloud-provider-alibaba
    - presubmits-cloud-provider-vsphere-blocking
    - presubmits-cluster-registry
    - presubmits-kops
    - presubmits-kube-batch
    - presubmits-kubernetes-blocking
    - presubmits-kubernetes-nonblocking
    - presubmits-kubernetes-scalability
    - presubmits-misc
    - presubmits-node-problem-detector
    - presubmits-poseidon
    - presubmits-test-infra
    ```
  
- Let's move another step forward. 

  Click on one of the dashboard tab under the `presubmits` dashboard-group & see what all CI jobs are added under this.
  
  Let's take `presubmits-kubernetes-blocking` as an example. Clicking this dashboard tab, will bring something like this ~
  
  ![Screenshot from 2021-06-10 23-47-09](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30499743/121576715-4808f480-ca46-11eb-951b-66c0d6f73bd8.png)
  
  Now, we could see all the various CI jobs collected under the `presubmits-kubernetes-blocking` dashboard, like ~ 
  
  `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind`, `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind-ipv6`, ... , `pull-kubernetes-unit`
  
  The source-code corresponding to this `presubmits-kubernetes-blocking` dashboard sits in the same config file, `presubmits/config.yaml` --> [kubernetes/test-infra/config/testgrids/kubernetes/presubmits/config.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/config/testgrids/kubernetes/presubmits/config.yaml).
  
  Something to note is that although all the CI jobs under this dashbaord will be listed in same config file, but those CI jobs may or may not be defined here (we'll discuss more about it, below in the notes).
  
- Continuing with the same `presubmits-kubernetes-blocking` dashboard example above, let's now explore the source-code for the various CI jobs listed under it:

  The following lines of code under the `dasboards` --> `name: presubmits-kubernetes-blocking` --> `dashboard_tab` section, defines what CI jobs will fall under this particular dashboard.
  
  ```yaml
  dashboards:
  
    ...
    
    - name: presubmits-kubernetes-blocking
    dashboard_tab:
    - name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind-ipv6
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind-ipv6
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-bazel-build
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-bazel-build
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-bazel-test
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-bazel-test
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-100-performance
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-100-performance
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-node-e2e
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-node-e2e
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-node-e2e-containerd
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-node-e2e-containerd
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-integration
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-integration
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-verify
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-verify
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-typecheck
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-typecheck
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-dependencies
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-dependencies
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-network-proxy-http-connect
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-network-proxy-http-connect
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-conformance-kind-ga-only-parallel
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-conformance-kind-ga-only-parallel
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-ubuntu-containerd
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-gce-ubuntu-containerd
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-verify-govet-levee
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-verify-govet-levee
      base_options: width=10
    - name: pull-kubernetes-files-remake
      test_group_name: pull-kubernetes-files-remake
      base_options: width=10
  ```
  
  Now, as we see, this section just lists what all CI jobs will go under this one specific dashboard tab, but the definition of these CI jobs are not given here.

  And that's our next step to explore below.

- These CI jobs under the `presubmits-kubernetes-blocking` tab are defined at multiple places based on the category or sub-project these CI job(s) fall into.

  *(something to note here is, one CI job can fall under multiple `dashboard` tabs, further under multiple `dashboard-groups`. So, that is one reason why these general purpose CI jobs are not defined just under one `dashboard-group` config file, but at certain separate places so they could be referenced by multiple dashboards)*
  
  Let's start by taking few of the CI jobs listed above under the `presubmits-kubernetes-blocking` dashboard tab for reference example:
  
  - The `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind` CI job is defined here ~ [kubernetes/test-infra/config/jobs/kubernetes/sig-testing/kubernetes-kind-presubmits.yaml#L3-L47](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/b1cb6db14e13aadc69ccb1e7e12e5d21e8555afd/config/jobs/kubernetes/sig-testing/kubernetes-kind-presubmits.yaml#L3-L47)

   ```yaml
    - name: pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind
      cluster: k8s-infra-prow-build
      optional: false
      always_run: true
      decorate: true
      skip_branches:
      - release-\d+\.\d+ # per-release settings
      labels:
        preset-dind-enabled: "true"
        preset-kind-volume-mounts: "true"
      decoration_config:
        timeout: 60m
        grace_period: 15m
      path_alias: k8s.io/kubernetes
      spec:
        containers:
        - image: gcr.io/k8s-testimages/krte:v20210512-b8d1b30-master
          command:
          - wrapper.sh
          - bash
          - -c
          - curl -sSL https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/latest/linux-amd64.tgz | tar xvfz - -C "${PATH%%:*}/" && e2e-k8s.sh
          env:
          - name: FOCUS
            value: "."
          # TODO(bentheelder): reduce the skip list further
          - name: SKIP
            value: \[Slow\]|\[Disruptive\]|\[Flaky\]|\[Feature:.+\]|PodSecurityPolicy|LoadBalancer|load.balancer|Simple.pod.should.support.exec.through.an.HTTP.proxy|subPath.should.support.existing|NFS|nfs|inline.execution.and.attach|should.be.rejected.when.no.endpoints.exist
          - name: PARALLEL
            value: "true"
          # we need privileged mode in order to do docker in docker
          securityContext:
            privileged: true
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: 7
              memory: 9000Mi
            requests:
              cpu: 7
              memory: 9000Mi
      annotations:
        testgrid-num-failures-to-alert: '10'
        testgrid-alert-stale-results-hours: '24'
        testgrid-create-test-group: 'true'
        fork-per-release: "true"
   ```
    
   Similarily, the CI jobs `pull-kubernetes-node-e2e` & `pull-kubernetes-node-e2e-conatinerd` are defined in this same one file, [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/bbcb6a5205090156e33e10f61e7619b27685d9ac/config/jobs/kubernetes/sig-node/sig-node-presubmit.yaml#L3-L42) & [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/bbcb6a5205090156e33e10f61e7619b27685d9ac/config/jobs/kubernetes/sig-node/sig-node-presubmit.yaml#L131-L172) respectively.
    
   For finding where rest of the CI jobs are defined under the `kubernetes/test-infra` repository, you can utilize the following:
     - Do a GitHub respository wide search.
       
       *for ex, [here I'm searching for where could be `pull-kubernetes-node-e2e` CI job in the `kubernetes/test-infra` repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/search?q=pull-kubernetes-node-e2e&type=)*
       
     - Dr do a similar search using [k8s hound search engine](https://cs.k8s.io).
     
       *for ex, [here I'm again searching for various places across the k8s projet, the `pull-kubernetes-node-e2e2` Ci job is referenced](https://cs.k8s.io/?q=pull-kubernetes-node-e2e&i=nope&files=&excludeFiles=&repos=)*


 - Moving one more step further in the testgrid dashboard, let's try to exapand & explore one of the CI jobs under one of the `dashboard` tabs now.

   In continuation to our above examples, let's try to see what comes when you click `presubmits` (dashboard-group) --> `presubmits-kubernetes-blocking` (dashboard-tab) --> `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind` (CI job):
   
   ![Screenshot from 2021-06-11 00-35-49](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30499743/121582815-16dff280-ca4d-11eb-8e24-21b597da7aec.png)

   We could see the following:
     - `on the left hand side, we see this wide grey section` ~ This is the logs generated (spread through multiple rows) when the CI job `pull-kubernetes-e2e-kind` ran.
     - `on the right hand side, we see the small tiles in green, red, white & grey colors` ~ These are statuses of this CI job run across a period of time (days, divided by hours, and so on). This tells us how this certain CI job is performing. 

   Based on how frequently, a certain CI job fails, you would also see that CI jobs are marked as `FLAKY`.
   
   The kind of calculations required to decide if a certain job will be marked as flaky based on "this is x no of times when this job failed", is done using the metrics calculation config files present here ~ [kubernetes/test-infra/metrics/configs](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/metrics/configs)
   
- And yea, finally we reached at the end. All these above steps can be repeated to understand different `dashboard-groups` --> `dashboards` --> `CI jobs` across the kubernetes prow testgrid platform.

That's all for the time! o/
