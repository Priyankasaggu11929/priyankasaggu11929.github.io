<p>November 5, 2018</p>
<p>Today was a normal day, spent well at my "Home Sweet Home" :)</p>
<p>Tried many things though.</p>
<ol>
<li>Gave a focused hour to Dvorak practice (trying to write this also in Dvorak :p, very slow though). Today's best time was around 7-8 min to write a paragraph of 100 words using <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/hrk.htm">Home Row Keys.</a></li>
<li> Practiced some Python problems, actually was trying to fill <a href="https://in.udacity.com/kpit-scholarship">https://in.udacity.com/kpit-scholarship</a>. The questions were a part of the form. Still struggling on writing the Typical "Goal-based questions".</li>
<li>Getting back to Emacs, revising <a href="https://www.dgplug.org/irclogs/2018/Logs-2018-08-16-14-28.txt">mbuf's emacs sessions</a> to get back to the track. Will soon start customizing emacs via setting up scrum-mode (if all goes well :) )</li>
<li>Struggling with my meditation also. :/</li>
</ol>
<p>Planning to be a part of some new but active open source community to promote community-based learning. Will write about it in the next blog, if get any progress towards that.</p>
<p>At last, thanks a lot to my mentor, who insisted me 1000 times to write but I, not being a good student, never wrote anything. But today is the day finally.</p>
<p>Hope to continue with it. \o/</p>
