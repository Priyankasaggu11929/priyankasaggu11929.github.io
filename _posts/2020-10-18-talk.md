A couple of weeks back (October 4, 2020), I was invited by DSC TIET (Developer Students Clud, Thaper University), to share my experience during my Outreachy internship & being a part of the open source communities in general. I'm glad I got this chance, & even more grateful that folks heard me nicely for around 45-50 minutes. :) 

Here is the link to the recorded session:
