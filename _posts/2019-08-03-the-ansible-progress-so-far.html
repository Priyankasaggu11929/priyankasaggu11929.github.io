<p>[<strong>Note</strong>: This post will cover the work progress from last 2 days, i.e. August 1st and 2nd.]</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am learning <a href="https://www.ansible.com/">ansible</a> now. It was not a really smooth passage to the point where I am right now in ansible. But today, with<em> literally lots of efforts</em>, I finally managed to run some first few ansible-playbooks on a remote node. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>(Maybe, it's not ansible which is hard to learn, but my curiosity/stupidity to jump into multiple things at the same time, made it an absolute pain in the brain.)</em></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>From past 4-5 days, I was just struggling to get myself a proper setup, where I can test my ansible-playbooks. And it was not happening only. It may be because I was thinking like I can experiment on multiple things at the same time (like working on Docker containers for the VMs). If I try to put my problems in a chronological order, it will look something like this:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>The first thought was to get myself an alternative solution for GCP VM instances and I finally ended up working with Docker containers. That was an addition to me, but a real exhausting frustration at the same time. For continuous 2 days, I was just recursively downloading the minimal dependencies and packages on the bare docker containers. And I finally decided to give up after <a href="http://kushaldas.in">Kushal</a>'s advice to not work on multiple nodes, but just start with one at a time. And I thank him no end for this. :)</li>
<li>In between, there was a time when I had a temporary setup of 4 VM nodes using docker containers. And I was able to SSH into all the three "end nodes" from the one main "control node". I assumed that it will work for ansible as well, but it proved me wrong. I was trying to use ansible "<em>ping module</em>" to ping the other three nodes. But sadly, it was not happening in Docker containers. Everytime, the nodes were unreachable. So, that was the moment when I finally decided to leave docker behind.</li>
<li>After docker, I came to my usual GCP VMs. And yeah, the <em>"ping module</em>" worked this time. But again while running ansible playbooks for automating stuffs like nginx-setup and apache-setup, I met with another problem of "<a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/580753/ssh-aborts-with-too-many-authentication-failures"><em>SSH aborting with too many authentication failure</em>s</a>" and "<em><a href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/43830">Authentication or permission failure</a></em>". It was ultimately resulting into nothing but unreachable nodes. After lots of tinkering on web and amendments in ssh and ansible config files. I finally got the one-liner solution for this. And this time, the happiness was no end. :D</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code># In your ansible.cfg change "remote_temp" variable to the following.

remote_tmp = /tmp/.ansible-${USER}/tmp</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>So, now, the nodes were reachable through ansible and I was trying to write plays for setting up apache in the remote node (Ubuntu 18.04 machine). The next error came while using "apt" module and it was:-</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied)\nE: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend)</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And I did exhaustive search and tried almost every possible solution on web to check this, but it didn't happened to be solved. So, finally had to change the playbook.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Now, after changing the playbook and adding certain other values, like setting up "become" and "become_method" values to provide <strong>sudo</strong> permissions. It happened. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p><strong><em>Finally the ansible-playbook did the work and made changes on the remote node as it was supposed to do.</em></strong>ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰</p>

<p>Besides, adding my first two working playbooks here. :)</p>

<li>The most basic and simple one. [Just to ping all the hosts and check if they respond or not. ]</li>
