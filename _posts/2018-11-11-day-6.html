<p>A whole day traveling and bad health, today.</p>

<blockquote><p>Facebook, Instagram, and all the rest are highlight reels. We filter out all the crap in our lives and post only the best moments to these platforms. So youâ€™re comparing this very second of your life to someoneâ€™s best moment of their best day of the past few months? Whatâ€™s that going to get you besides some misery?</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Its not easy to learn to listen and put some effort into a relationship. In a way, itâ€™s deep work.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Makes me remember that I still have to complete the book "Deep work" by Cal Newport.)</p>
