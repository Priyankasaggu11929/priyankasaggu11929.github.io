***Quick notes from today:***

#### `bump hcsshim version to v0.8.17`

- Created a PR to bump `hcsshim` version to `v0.8.17` in [containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd). Link to the PR here ~ [containerd/containerd/pull/5505](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/5505)
- There were 2 failing CI tests:
    - **[CI / Linux Integration (io.containerd.runc.v2, crun) (pull_request)](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/5505/checks?check_run_id=2590402439)**
        - This one failed at the CRI Integration Test ~ [.github/workflows/ci.yml#L445-L450](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/08fa9ab625103b43174497911caf74bdeb0fc0f9/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L445-L450)
        - Failing at this line ~ [script/test/utils.sh#L78](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/script/test/utils.sh#L78)
    - **[CI / CGroupsV2 and SELinux Integration (runc) (pull_request)](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/5505/checks?check_run_id=2590402511)**
        - This one failed at the CRI test ~ [.github/workflows/ci.yml#L562-L566](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L562-L566)
- I spent quite a good long time doing the above troubleshooting, ending up finally realising that I missed cleaning/updating the integration tests under containerd (defined [here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/master/integration)) which ultimately led to the above CI tests failing.
- The above missing step resulted into not updating the `containerd` version to `v1.5.1` & `runc` version to `v1.0.0-rc94` in the containerd integrations tests.
- So, now, I've just ran `go mod tidy` under the [containerd/integration/client](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/tree/master/integration) module, which finally updated the `containerd` & `runc` to required appropriate versions. 
- ~Currently I'm waiting for the CI tests run to finish.~ The CI tests are all green. ðŸŽŠ Now, I'll be waiting for the final review.

That's all for the day!

PS: I created two dedicated kubernetes page on the blog. One for collecting all the *upstream kubernetes contributions* & second to collecy all the kubernetes posts in one place. Find links to both of the pages, [here](https://www.psaggu.com/kubernetes-blogs.html) & [here](https://www.psaggu.com/kubernetes.html).
