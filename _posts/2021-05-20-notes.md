***Quick notes from today:***

#### `k8s org(s) membership`

- Finally got the kubernetes org(s) invitation emails in the inbox. üòÅ üíÉ. It really feels like I've earned them, this time! ‚ù§Ô∏è

#### `structured-logging KEP review session`

- Had a very deep dive through the [structured logging KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-instrumentation/1602-structured-logging#motivation). Logged all my review notes in [this hackmd document](https://hackmd.io/qDIg8R-lSNa7oqWKsnIT5Q?view#Release-Signoff-Checklist). 
    - Presented my review notes & the KEP idea to dims. He wanted me to present the KEP idea to him as if I was presenting that in a SIG meeting as my own proposal. It was a really good exercise. I got good comments. :)
- More stuff that I discussed during today's (weekly Thursday) 1:1 meeting with dims are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ekAkKUt67WH_7nYrA3imDWTFVeY69a9y1qi_fruGksg/edit)

#### `bump containerd & runc on kubernetes CI jobs`

- [Raised this PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22273) on the `kubernetes/test-infra` project to bump the `runc` version to `v1.0.0-rc95`, & `containerd` version to `v1.5.2` in the kubernetes CI jobs.
