<p><strong>Teaching is the best way of learning!</strong></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Finished my third session with junior folks. I got so many criticizing feedbacks today for the session being too slow, or not having physical sessions with them. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I accept each one of theirs whole-heartedly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I just have one thing to say. I don't want any student of mine to lag behind. I wish, everyone should have their doubts resolved. If solving their doubts makes the session slow. I want every session to be slow. Because, this is what a good teacher should do, solve his/her student's doubt until they are ready to move forward. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am trying my best to be a good teacher. And I wish everyone would soon learn the lesson of being patient too. :)</p>
