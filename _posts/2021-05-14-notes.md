***Quick notes from today:***

#### `Bumping containerd version to v1.5.1`

- Bumped the containered version to the GA version `v1.5.1` in the following projects:
    - `microsoft/hcsshim` ~ [bump containerd version to v1.5.1 #1027](https://github.com/microsoft/hcsshim/pull/1027#event-4745184459)
    - `google/cadvisor` ~ [bump containerd version to v1.5.1 #2870](https://github.com/google/cadvisor/pull/2870)
    - `kubernetes/image-builder` ~ [bump containerd version to v1.5.1 #610](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/image-builder/pull/610)
    - `kubernetes/test-infra` ~ [bump containerd version to v1.5.1 #22178](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/pull/22178)

#### `Dropping python2 support from k8s-client/python & k8s-client/python-base`

- Working on the PRs that will drop the python2 support from the `kubernetes-client/python` & `kubernetes-client/python-base` repositories.
    - `kubernetes-client/python-base` ~ [[WIP] drop python2 support #238](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python-base/pull/238)
    - `kubernetes-client/python` ~ [[WIP] drop python 2 support #1468](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python/pull/1468)

- Both of the PRs are work in progress (WIP). The work done in both the repos, so far is:
    - removed python2 from the `.travis.yaml` file
    - remove python2 from the `tox.ini` file
    - remove `-y` flag from isort command in `update-pycodestle.sh` script
    - fix sequence of module imports to fix the failing `pycodestyle` checks in the following files:
        - examples/multiple_clusters.py
        - examples/pick_kube_config_context.py
        - examples/pod_config_list.py
    - tested `coverage` & `codecov` tests with python3 version (currently `v3.9`)
    - tested updated `update-pycodestyle` for python3 version `v3.9` in case of arch `ppc6le`

#### `dedicated kubernetes contribution page on blog`

- I have created a [dedicated page for logging & tracking all my upstream Kuberenetes project contributions](https://www.psaggu.com/kubernetes.html), on the blog.
