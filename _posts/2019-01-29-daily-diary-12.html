<p>Today, I realized how hard it is to teach someone, and that too, specifically, on IRC. The mark reached its peak when I was individually helping every student almost for the entire day and suddenly, some of them got bored and left the channel. ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜›</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anyways, this was an admirable experience as I got to teach junior folks in the same way, How I had learned from some of the finest mentors in the world.</p>

<p>This was Day 1 of teaching in #GirlScriptSnp. Looking forward to having some more fun learning sessions with the junior folks soon.</p>

<p>Logs to today's session can be found <a href="https://github.com/Priyankasaggu11929/GirlScriptSonipat/blob/master/Day1Jan29_2019">here.</a></p>

<p>And yeah, I have added some more functionalities in <a href="https://priyankasaggu119.wordpress.com/2019/01/29/gbot-irc-bot-in-python/">gbot (IRC bot)</a>. Check out the updates in <a href="https://github.com/Priyankasaggu11929/gbot_ircbot">here</a>.</p>
