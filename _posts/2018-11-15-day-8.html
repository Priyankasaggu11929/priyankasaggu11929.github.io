<li>Did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ik6X4DJKCc&amp;list=PLillGF-RfqbYE6Ik_EuXA2iZFcE082B3s">crash course on Javascript</a>(recommend to everyone who wants to quickly go through Javascript for web). Needed to quickly revise all the javascript I have done so far for DOM manipulation, querying and traversal.</li>
<li>Read <a href="https://www.safalniveshak.com/how-to-get-wealthy/">How to Get Wealthy (Over Time).</a> Happy as my <a href="https://mjbraganza.com/">mentor</a> has already taught a lot to me about this earlier. So, was very easy to understand. :)</li>
<li>Recently have taken an initiative with a friend to help folks junior to us in our University, to start with learning Programming and other Software skills. So, spent time in the Slack channel helping the folks.</li>
