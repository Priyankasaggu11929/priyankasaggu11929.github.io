Too tired to write a detailed technical blogpost today. So, will try to keep it short & simple, and just writing about some updates here.

I gave my first ever talk yesterday. It finally happened! (*this is a note for myself* :P). 

I procastinated for how long I don't even remember now. Even I don't know if it was just procastination or was accompanied by my some more lame thoughts & nervoursness. ***But, it happened finally and I am really happy about it.*** :)

A big *thanks* to Mridu Bhatnagar, who very kindly offered me her slot & that's how I just got this very impromptu chance of presenting a talk at *Pyladies Delhi online meetup*. Thank you soooo much. üôèÔ∏è

Ok, so actually the talk was about *Introduction to Github Actions*, followed by a quick handson. I'm putting the slides here:

I just haven't got enough time to prepare nicely for the talk. So, whatever I delivered was more of a last minute thing.

But this one time(the talk I mean) gave me a good enough confidence to apply, share & present more in the coming times.

Today, I upgraded my local machine OS to Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (focal fossa). 

Damn, I invested a huge data for this install (oh yea, I'm real miser when it comes to my data üòÖÔ∏è).

But cool, it has some really good additions (*So far, I just got to read about them. I'm yet to explore more about these new additions/features in practice*). Look & feel is almost same like the last non-LTS release, Ubuntu 19.10. Overall, a nice & sleek user experience.

That's all for this time. I didn't want to break my writing streak. So, this is to make sure that something goes onto my blog once every 2 weeks. :)
