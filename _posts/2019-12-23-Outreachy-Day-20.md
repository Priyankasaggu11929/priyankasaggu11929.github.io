December 23, 2019

I didn't write for the last 3 days of the last week. The reason being I was terribly occupied in finishing some impromptu work. 

And now, I'm back here again with my daily writing. :)

**Task for the week:**

- <strike>Read about Gtk Widgets and Layouts Properly.</strike>[finished]
 
**Progress of the day:**

- I finished reading the *tutorials* based on creating widgets and layouts from the official documentation.

- Next, I figured out how to properly use [GtkInspector](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GTK/Inspector?action=show&redirect=Projects%2FGTK%2B%2FInspector) tool. And that actually helped me figuring out where (like in what file or on top of what layout) I have to add the re-created widget in the Gtranslator project and a little bit of the *how part* as well ( right now can't say it for 100% before actually trying :) ).

- Also, read about how to add keyboard shortcuts for widgets in the application (yet to implement).

That's all for today. I will try to be regular here. o/
