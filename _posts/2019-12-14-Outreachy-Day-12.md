December 14, 2019

**Task for the week:**

- Try to replicate the gnome-builder “search and replace bar” widget (just the wire-frame) in the Gtranslator project.
  - [sub-task] First try doing the above task in a seperate simple application.

**Progress of the day:**

- More progress today. I was able to run the application with the re-created widget files (though I can't invoke the widget even now but there are no more funny *"missing components"* or *"undefined references"* errors which is a good thing for moving on nicely). With this pace, I hope I'll finish the sub-task for the week very soon (although, I'm taking it to next week as well but it's ok. After all, this *is* the *most important* part of the project or is the project itself actually). 

- I was testing the re-created widget files in the *gtranslator* application as well. But it definitely requires some more work (or maybe a lot, which I *hope* not to be the case) to have it actually working the intended way. But I'm glad that the actual project (gtranslator) is also running with no errors after adding these new files.

- Now that I have finished 2 weeks of working (only) on the project (apart from the initial contribution period), I feel a little extra more comfortable handling (and understading) the complex parts of the project. Nothing seems *really* alien-ish now (apparently because I'm working with multiple applications while taking references).


On and all, this week was a productive one as a whole. I have taken some major progressive steps in the project. Had a couple of *aha moments* as well (*mostly whenever things started making their actual sense*). And I'm happy about it. :)

That's all for now.

Be back on monday (or maybe... tomorrow also, will see) :)
