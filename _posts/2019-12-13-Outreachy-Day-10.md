December 12, 2019

**Task for the week:**

- Try to replicate the gnome-builder “search and replace bar” widget (just the wire-frame) in the Gtranslator project.
  - [sub-task] First try doing the above task in a seperate simple application. 

**Progress of the day:**

- Absolutely no progress for the day.
- I was having a *work block* (like the artists have *[art block](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgSQwpah3zQ)*). So, what I did was sleep and read about things that interest me (or I want to learn & explore more about). At most part, I read about RISC-V (pronounced as RISC-five) which is an open-source hardware ISA based on established reduced instruction set computer(RISC) principles.

[<strike>Okay, I am admitting. I even missed writing about it yesterday (it is December 13 now :P) and that was due to some reasons (not really *excuses).But since, I have all the magic powers to my place and walk down the time (at least here). So, it will be posted as on December 12 only because I don't want to break the streak as far as possible.</strike>
I think it's ok to break the streak rather being in self-guilt of lying to myself. So, back to today.]


Till tomorrow (okay tonight). o/
