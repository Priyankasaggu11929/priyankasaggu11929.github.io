***Very quick notes from this previous week:***

#### ***`passed Red Hat certified specialist in OpenShift Administration exam`***

This is what all I did for this last whole week (mostly).

- Prepared for the ***Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration (EX280V45K)*** exam.
- Appeared first time on June 15, 2021 (Tuesday) & failed with *a very not so good score*.
- Re-appeared on June 18, 2021 (Friday) & passed this time with good score.

And here is the **Certification ID:** `210-093-068`, that can be verified [here](https://www.redhat.com/rhtapps/certification/verify/?certId=210-093-068).

#### ***`attended community session on client-go informers code walk-through`***

This friday, I attended a k8s in-dev community session for the client-go informers codebase walk-through.

I was just aware of the term `informers` as in there is something, some concept, some component known as *informers* & this falls under the realm of `sig-api-machinery`. But that is all, what my understanding was before the session!

This session was more of a hacking session, as in both the presenter & the attendees together were trying to decypher stuff written in the codebase (this time for client-go informers). I liked this sort of learning, because it right away set a bar. The bar is not the technical understanding because ofcourse nobody is assuming people would understand the things being discussed beforehand. But the bar is that the session will only make sense & bring value to the people who would care to put in the time & attention & stick until the end.

***(And that's a choice ofcourse.)*** ðŸ™‚

For me, I absolutely learnt a lot.
- The least I know now,  ***what Informers are?*** 
- And the best I know ***where I could go & look into the [huge kubernetes codebase to understand more about it](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/staging/src/k8s.io/client-go/informers/generic.go)***. 

We also touched terms like `watchers`, `listwatchers` and `edge-triggered` & `level-triggered logics` but that's for me to explore more.

I'm putting all the useful links here for myself (so, I could later on refer them from here)

That's all for my this week!

I would call it a very productive week for me, both during the work & otherwise too.
