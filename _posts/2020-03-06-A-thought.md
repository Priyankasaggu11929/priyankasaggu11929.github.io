Just two of my **thoughts** that I want to quote here.

First

> The best feeling!
> 
>  When people come back to you and acknowledge your advice/guidance/help, by sharing their accomplishments.
>  
>  (and, yes) by saying ***thank you***. ðŸ™‚

And Second,

> I'm ***publicly*** committing to ***not commit*** anything to the ***public***.
>
>  I mean ***why I have to commit anything to the public***?
>
>  The ***public*** won't come back and push me forward when I'll be stuck in my own funny confusion & problems.
>
>  Therefore, better:
>
>  1. I commit to **myself** (this one, I recommend it to everyone).
>  2. Or I commit to my mentors (oh yeah, I'm lucky enough to have some really good ones in my life), my parents, and **myself** (because that is still mandatory).
>  3. Or yes, I commit to my pocket payers (Ofcourse, I ought to do that) but again first **myself**!
