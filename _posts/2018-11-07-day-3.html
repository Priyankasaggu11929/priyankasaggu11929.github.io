<p>November 7, 2018</p>
<p>A very Happy Diwali to everyone. 🙏 🎇 ✨</p>
<p>Today was a festive day and so, was busy with family for the entire time. Nothing new happened but then the whole family together is in itself a moment of joy and celebration for us (at least for folks like me whose every family member lives in different places) :) .</p>
<p>For the logs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gave an hour to Emacs Revision, done with Class 1 and 2.</li>
<li> <img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-41" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot-from-2018-11-07-23-29-39.png?w=1024" alt="Screenshot from 2018-11-07 23-29-39" width="1024" height="576" />Created a demo blog site on Nikola.</li>
<li>No specific practice hour to Dvorak, but then practiced all the commands in emacs and internet surfing, in Dvorak only. And yes, while writing this blog also. 😇</li>
</ol>
<p>and nothing more. Helped Mommy with household chores, cooking and Daddy with Pooja preparations and that's it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow again is a day of celebration for the family. Ah, not Goverdhan Pooja, but then will let you know in next one ;) .</p>
<p>Till then, take care. o/</p>
