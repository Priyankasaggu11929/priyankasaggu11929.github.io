January 08, 2020

**Task for the week:**

- Move the existing search-and-replace-bar widget functionality to the new redesigned overlay widget.

**Progress of the day:**

- This week started on a good note. I spent the first 2 days working on the final nitpicks for the UI of the widget. 

- Today, I added CSS rules for creating a border around the "search entry and buttons grid". 

- Also, I corrected the position of the widget. Earlier it was being rendered down below the `EventBox` progress bar and thus, the overlay effect was absent. Some more tweaks in the xml file solved this issue. And thus, I have finally reached half way to finishing my project.

  <source src="/assets/widget.webm" type="video/mp4">
</video>

That's all for now. Will slowly start adding functionality to the widget tommorow onwards. :)
