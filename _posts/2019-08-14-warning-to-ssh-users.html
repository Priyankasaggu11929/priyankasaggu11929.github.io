<p>Okay, not to worry. There is no such actual warning. :D</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I am just trying to extend my previous post on <a href="https://priyankasaggu119.wordpress.com/2019/08/12/a-guide-to-a-safer-ssh/">securing SSH</a> by adding another <s>one-liner </s>(actually it was one liner before I decided to implement it with ansible again) solution to it.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And the solution is:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:quote --></p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>You can add <strong>"warning banners"</strong> for the incoming nodes which are trying to establish a SSH connection to your concerned nodes. These banners will give a proper insight of the guidelines and the measures, the authorities are imposing on users to ensure their server's safety and security.</em></p>
<p><cite>me :P</cite></p></blockquote>
<p><!-- /wp:quote --></p>
<p><!-- wp:list --></p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding the same ansible playbook we built in the <a href="https://priyankasaggu119.wordpress.com/2019/08/12/a-guide-to-a-safer-ssh/">last post</a>, edit the file "<em>/playbook/ssh/tasks/main.yml</em>" to add the following lines in there.
<ul>
<li>The new tasks will do the following:
<ul>
<li>Find the line "#Banner none" in <em>sshd_config</em> file and replacing it with "Banner /etc/issue".</li>
<li>Copy the contents of "ssh/templates/issue" file to remote node's "/etc/issue" file.</li>
<li>And finally restart the <em>ssh service daemon</em> again to reflect the changes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- /wp:list --></p>
<p><!-- wp:code --></p>
<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>- regexp: "^#?Banner none"
  line: "Banner /etc/issue"

- name: Copy the banner issue file in remote node
  copy:
    src: /etc/ansible/playbooks/ssh/templates/issue
    dest: /etc/issue
    owner: root
    group: root
    mode: 0644</code></pre>
<p><!-- /wp:code --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After adding the above lines, the actual "<strong>ssh</strong>" ansible role will now look like this:</p>

<li>The contents of "<strong>/etc/ansible/playbooks/ssh/templates/issue</strong>" can be written like the  following example template (This example template is taken from <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-unix-bsd-openssh-server-best-practices.html">here</a>.)</li>

<p>So, now, after implementing the new modified ansible playbook again, if someone tries to establish a SSH connection to our concerned nodes, they will be welcomed with a <strong><em>warning banner</em></strong> like this.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/screenshot-from-2019-08-14-04-39-20-1.png" alt="warning banner" class="wp-image-775" /><br />

<p>I found this small approach towards SSH security, very interesting, thus, writing it down here.</p>

<p>That's all for this short post. Hope it helps!</p>
