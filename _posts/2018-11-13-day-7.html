<p>November 12, 2018</p>
<p>After a stressful Sunday, today, finally got back to work.</p>
<p>For the logs:</p>
<ol>
<li>The whole day, I wrote Assignments. And, yes finally done with each one of them. (And this is 02:20 am of November 13, 2018 :) )</li>
</ol>
<p>Have to come back to learning, but now have exams on the head. Will try to make a good plan and then start.</p>
<p>That's all for now.</p>
<p>Good night, folks. :)</p>
