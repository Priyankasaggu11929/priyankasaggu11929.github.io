Dear Team,

As my last day at VMware approaches, I wanted to take a moment to thank each and every one of you for the support and guidance you have given me during my time at VMware.

To [dims](https://twitter.com/dims) and [Navid](https://twitter.com/_navidshaikh), I am especially grateful for helping me join the great organisation and for your ongoing support. Thank you for making me feel welcomed and valued from day one.

[Nikhita](https://twitter.com/thenikhita), your support and sponsorship have been invaluable in helping me grow in my career. You are not only a great colleague, but also a wonderful friend inside and outside of VMware. I truly mean it when I say that YOU ARE MY ROLE MODEL.

[Meghana](https://mobile.twitter.com/cloudwarfare_), thank you for being an amazing onboarding buddy and for being there for me through every challenge and success. Your friendship, kindness and selflessness means the world to me.

[Arka](https://twitter.com/thenikhita) and [Yash](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjApNj7sPP7AhVaUGwGHWiSBmAQFnoECBIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fin.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fyash-kumar-singh-372340a9&usg=AOvVaw23Sh-1zocHMl2tvTfQ9NZG), thank you for being amazing work partners and for the countless long troubleshooting and learning sessions we had together.

Finally, [Kriti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kriti-gautam-03591142/), [Kiran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kriti-gautam-03591142/), and [Gaurav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaurav-bulchandani/?originalSubdomain=in), thank you for supporting me throughout my journey at VMware.

**PS:** 

It's amazing that the "DREAM TEAM" [tweet](https://twitter.com/TheNikhita/status/1271269315698765824) that you posted about years ago, [Nikhita](https://twitter.com/thenikhita), actually came together for me and I got to work with you. It's still hard to believe it actually happened. Honestly, I'm feeling very emotional after typing this. Thank you for all your support always! ❤️
