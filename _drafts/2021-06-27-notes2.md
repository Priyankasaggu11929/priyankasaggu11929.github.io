clone the repo

go to the pkg/templates folder

make a new directory with the name of the new check. For example, `NewTestCheck`. 

Under that folder, make the following:
- create the following files, `template.go` & `template_test.go`
- creater another folder `internal/params/` & then touch a file `params.go`


We will write the actual new test check in the template.go file

the internal/params/params.go file will contain the paramaters required for the test check. 

And finally, when we are done writing the test in template.go test file, we will write unit tests to validate this new check in `template_test.go` file


Once the test & the unit test, all are in place & we are happy with the new test check logic

go to the pkg/templates/all folder & modify the all.go file to include the path to our new test, i.e. pkg/templates/newtestcheck

Then to include this test as a builtin check, go to the pkg/builtin-checks/yaml folder & make a new yaml file new-test-check.yaml 

We will reference our new test check template in this file, along with passing default paramaeter values required by the check validation logic & also, define the scope of the test as well

So far the new test is a builtin check, but it is not a default check

if you want to make your test check, a default check

go to internal/defaultchecks/defaultcheck.go file & add the new check name here

That's all. Once you're done, it's time to do the testing

run make generated-srcs

this will generate all the auto-generated templates & checks file for the kube-linter command line tool to reference & also the documentations

you could run a single test as

/bin/linux/kube-linter lint --do-not-include-builtin-checks --include new-test-check examples/deployment.yaml

if all goes well

then run gofmt -s -w on all the new go files you have added in the process of adding a new check

& then raise a PR for the upstream project

Thats all
