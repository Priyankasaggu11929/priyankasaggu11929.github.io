***Ok, I realised If there is something even more important than tracking my [physical fitness](https://priyankasaggu11929.github.io/fitness.html), it's my mental fitness & thus, my meditation.***

***And so, now I'm going to track my meditation too, here...***

*(Because it's still the hardest thing to keep at it, but it's definitely the most rewarding thing in life.)*

*(For someone who might want to start, I use this [tara barach's meditation stream](http://www.tarabrach.com/audio/2010-07-07-Smile-Meditation-TaraBrach.mp3) and [headspace](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3JhfsgFPLSLNEROQCdj-GQ).)*
