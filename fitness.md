***And here, I (hope to) log my weight-loss journey...***

Something that I could read overtime for my own inspiration. :)

*(The progress will be updated at the top weekly)*

And, just to break the jargons,

- <sub>hw: highest weight</sub>
- <sub>sw: starting weight</sub>
- <sub>cw: current weight</sub>
- <sub>gw: goal weight</sub>

Okay, let's start:

    - hw: 95.7 kgs (2019/11/21)
    - sw: 93.1 kgs (2020/01/13)

*April 25, 2020*

    - cw: 82.3 kgs (2020/04/25)

    - gw1: 81 kgs
    - gw2: 78 kgs
    - gw3: 75 kgs
    - gw4: 73 kgs
    - gw5: 70 kgs
    - gw6: 67 kgs

<sub>It was a *total* frustrating week. I'm trying to be more patient with the process though. </sub>
<sub>Lost a kilo weight, accompanied by muscle loss & just a little fat loss. And I missed 2 days of exercise, so that counts for 5/7. Really need to work more towards being consistent.</sub>

    - cw: 83.3 kgs (2020/04/18)

    - gw1: 81 kgs
    - gw2: 78 kgs
    - gw3: 75 kgs
    - gw4: 73 kgs
    - gw5: 70 kgs
    - gw6: 67 kgs

<sub>Some fat loss, some muscle gain and I'm half a kilo down too. That's exactly how I want it to happen. </sub>
<sub>And the best part, I didn't miss my 15-20 min exercise at all. \o/</sub>
