***And here, I (hope to) log my weight-loss journey...***

Something that I could read overtime for my own inspiration. :)

*(The progress will be updated at the top weekly)*

And, just to break the jargons,

- <sub>hw: highest weight</sub>
- <sub>sw: starting weight</sub>
- <sub>cw: current weight</sub>
- <sub>gw: goal weight</sub>

Okay, let's start:

    - hw: 95.7 kgs (2019/11/21)
    - sw: 93.1 kgs (2020/01/13)

*May 15, 2020*

    - cw: 78.6 kgs (2020/05/15)

    - gw1: 81 kgs ‚úîÔ∏è
    - gw2: 78 kgs
    - gw3: 75 kgs
    - gw4: 73 kgs
    - gw5: 70 kgs
    - gw6: 67 kgs

**<sub>Early update!</sub>**

*<sub>(The weight loss is uncertain. Who knows if the number goes up again. So, I decided to celebrate today's victory today itself.)</sub>*

<sub>I've lost 10kgs from the day I came back home in March(due to the lockdown), which means, I'm 14.5 kgs down from the starting weight & 17.1 kgs down from the highest weight (from nov,2019).</sub>

<sub>These number makes me super proud of myself today.üôÇÔ∏è</sub>

*<sub> This is much much mucccch more than the highest weight I have ever lost in one go before.</sub>*

<sub>In additon, my metabolic age on scale also slid down by 1. So, 29 from 30 now. It actually took me almost 7 months to get this number down by 1 today. :)</sub>

*May 9, 2020*

    - cw: 80.4 kgs (2020/05/09)

    - gw1: 81 kgs ‚úîÔ∏è
    - gw2: 78 kgs
    - gw3: 75 kgs
    - gw4: 73 kgs
    - gw5: 70 kgs
    - gw6: 67 kgs

<sub>Ok'ish week.</sub>

<sub>600gms down from last week. But it was a *veeeeery slow process* this time. </sub>

<sub>Although, a good thing happened. I slid down to *Overweight* range from *too high*. I mean I'm still overweight but that is much much much better than falling above that.</sub>

<sub>That's all. No good progress in the exercise. I think my body needs more rest & energy than I'm getting these days.</sub>

*<sub>I'm realising everyday that I need to be really patient on this journey.</sub>*

*May 2, 2020*

    - cw: 81.0 kgs (2020/05/02)

    - gw1: 81 kgs ‚úîÔ∏è
    - gw2: 78 kgs
    - gw3: 75 kgs
    - gw4: 73 kgs
    - gw5: 70 kgs
    - gw6: 67 kgs

<sub>Here I go! (lost 1.3 kgs) üéâÔ∏è</sub>

<sub>Yesterday, (even after a gradual weight loss throughout the week) I gained a good odd 600gms of weight, which eventually made me lose all my hope for achieving the first gw today.</sub>

<sub>But it happened *today* and I'm very happy about it. :)</sub>

*<sub>TIL, how good it is to divide the journey into multiple small milestones. If it wasn't the first milestone, I wouldn't have acknowledged my own efforts. </sub>*

<sub>Anyways, a very bad record of exercise this week (2/7 if I do it today). I was super lethargic all throughout the week due to poor sleeping hours or I don't know what.</sub>
 
***<sub>Ok, no more excuses now. I will do better this week. :)</sub>***

    - gw2: 78 kgs
    - gw3: 75 kgs
    - gw4: 73 kgs
    - gw5: 70 kgs
    - gw6: 67 kgs

<sub>It was a *total* frustrating week. I'm trying to be more patient with the process though. </sub>

<sub>Lost a kilo weight, accompanied by muscle loss & just a little fat loss. And I missed 2 days of exercise, so that counts for 5/7. Really need to work more towards being consistent.</sub>
