***I'm not a book reading nerd at all. Infact, I struggle to finish even one book for months or years.***

***But I like reading books (or listening to them. This is another way I try hard to keep this habit intact).***

***So, whenever it happens, i.e. I manage to read some book(s), I feel very happy! (obvious na, yea 😆)***

***I'll keep this page for my very short list of books that I'm reading or I've finished!***
