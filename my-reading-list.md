***I'm not a book reading nerd at all. Infact, I struggle to finish even one book for months or years.***

***But I like reading books (or listening to them. This is another way I try hard to keep this habit intact).***

***And so, whenever it happens, i.e. whenever I manage to read & make little progress in any book, I feel very happy! (obviously, yea)*** ðŸ˜†.

***And, I count that as my SMALL LITTLE WIN!*** ðŸ¥³

***I'll keep this page for my very short list of books that I'm reading or I've finished!***
